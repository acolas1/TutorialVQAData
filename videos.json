            ">> There are a variety of ways to share a design you build in Photoshop in print, on screen, and online.",
            "In this video, we'll talk about saving and exporting a design in common formats for different uses.",
            "First, you'll save the master copy of your design in native Photoshop format or .PSD.",
            "When creating a layered composition like you did, it's really important to preserve the master, full size version of the design so that you can always access and re-edit any of the layers, adjustments, and effects you added in Photoshop.",
            "Choose File, Save As.",
            "In the Save As dialog box, change the name to \"Design-complete.\"",
            "Choose Photoshop from the Format or Type, make sure Layers is checked to preserve them, and click Save to save it to your hard drive.",
            "Click OK to maximize compatibility so that even an application that can't read layers like Lightroom will be able to open this file.",
            "Now you have a full size master version of the file for future editing.",
            "With this master file, you can output copies of your design in other formats and other sizes for use in particular projects.",
            "If you want to hand your file off for review or printing by someone who doesn't have Photoshop, you can save a copy in PDF format.",
            "To do that, choose File, Save As.",
            "Leave Layers checked, choose Photoshop PDF, and click Save.",
            "Click OK at the warning.",
            "In the Save Adobe PDF dialog box, leave the settings at their default unless you're sending the file to a print provider who specifies otherwise.",
            "And click Save PDF.",
            "Then click Yes.",
            "This PDF copy of the file can be opened using a PDF reader like the free Adobe Reader.",
            "If the file is opened in Photoshop, its layers will still be available.",
            "Now let's talk about outputting a design for use online.",
            "You can use Photoshop's Export features to output an entire or individual layers in formats that are best for online use.",
            "To save the entire design, you can choose File, Export, Export As.",
            "You can see the design preview in the middle, and you can choose an image Format here.",
            "We can choose JPG for photo-based designs, GIF or PNG for graphic-intensive designs, or even SVG for scalable vector graphics.",
            "Exporting in these formats will flatten the design, meaning we can no longer access the layers in the image file.",
            "This design has lots of photography content, so I'll export it in JPG format.",
            "I'll choose from the options on the right, reducing the Quality and dimensions to reduce file size if I need to.",
            "There are also options for including Copyright and Contact Information and for converting the exported image to the sRGB Color Space for online use.",
            "Then I'll click Export All to save a copy of the entire design as a flattened JPG.",
            "You can also export assets on individual layers like the logo.",
            "Just select the layer in the Layers panel, right click, and choose Export As.",
            "The Export As dialog box opens again.",
            "I'll choose SVG as the Format this time.",
            "Click Export All and save just this logo to your hard drive.",
            "When you're ready to close this file, you can choose File, Close.",
            "As you dive further into Photoshop, you'll learn that there are other more advanced design-related features and techniques that can make your design vision a reality, such as Artboards for designing for mobile and web, Creative Cloud Libraries, integration of Adobe Stock, Layer Comps, a special design preview work space, and much more.",
            "You'll find lots of information about these and other Photoshop design features like these in the many Adobe Learn tutorials for Photoshop at Adobe.com."

            "The layers panel in Photoshop will be an integral part of your workflow.",
            "It's the place we go to manage the layers in a composition.",
            "In the layers panel there's now just one layer called background.",

            "Choose edit, fill.",
            "Choose color from the contents menu, and we'll pick a color using the color picker that opens. Drag this slider up a bit so we get into the orangish area.",

            "You can freely move or scale vector graphics without loosing detail or clarity.",
            "That's why vector is a great choice for a logo or a graphic.",
            "Let's start by creating a vector shape in Photoshop.",

            "In the Options bar, click the arrow in the Shape option to view the shape picker so we can see default shapes.",

            "As you click on different colors, the start shape changes color on the fly. I'll pick white and click OK to close the color picker.",
            "Because this is a vector shape, you can edit it without degrading its quality.",

            "I'll turn it back on.",
            "We'll use a layer mask to hide just the top part of the landscape layer so we can see through that to the sky in the layer below.",
            "We'll start by selecting the part of the landscape layer we don't want to hide, the foreground.",

            "Where there's gray paint on the mask, the sun is only partially hidden.",
            "Now say you change your mind and want to show the entire sun again.",

            "Then paint with white in the same area of the mask to reveal the sun.",
            "Another way to hide part of a layer with the layer mask is to add a black/white gradient to the mask.",
            "This is a good way to blend one image into the other.",
            "Let's add a gradient to the sun layer mask so the sun appears to fade away at the bottom.",
            "Make sure the mask thumbnail on the sun layer is selected.",

            "Take a look at the mask in the layers panel, and you'll see a white-to-black gradient. I'll click this layer mask thumbnail while holding down the option or alt key.",
            "Now you can really see how the mask fades from white which reveals through shades of gray which partially reveal to black which conceals.",
            "I'll option or alt click the layer mask icon again to return to normal view.",
            "When you're making a composite design like this, use layer masks as a way to hide part of an image without actually deleting any of the image.",

            "Welcome to Get Started with Photoshop for Photography.",
            "In this series of videos, I'll walk you through the basics of editing a photograph in Photoshop from your first editing steps to saving a polished version.",
            "When you finish watching the series, you'll be able to use the Photoshop fundamentals you learn here to make your own photographs look fantastic.",
            "We'll focus on editing in Photoshop in this series, but keep in mind that using Photoshop and Lightroom together are the perfect combination for photography.",
            "You can organize, edit, and share your photos in Lightroom and take them even further in Photoshop.",
            "In this video, I'll cover opening, cropping, and straightening a photo in Photoshop.",
            "Let's begin in the Start screen which you'll see when you launch this version of Photoshop.",
            "Open the sample image we're providing or your own photo by clicking the Open button on the Start screen or by choosing File, Open to locate an image.",
            "When the image opens, activate the crop tool in the Tools panel, and a resizable crop box immediately surrounds your image.",
            "You can drag any corner or any edge to adjust the shape of the box, and you can click and drag within the box to reposition the photo underneath it.",
            "When you do, Photoshop darkens the soon-to-be cropped away pixels outside the box, giving you a preview of what the crop will look like.",
            "To constrain the crop to a certain size, use the menu at the left of the Options bar at the top of your screen which includes some commonly used crop presets.",
            "For example, to preserve the photo's original aspect ratio, choose Original Ratio.",
            "Now as you adjust the crop box, the photo's original relationship of width to height is preserved.",
            "If you want to crop your photo to particular dimensions rather than ratios, you can choose from this section of the menu which includes options in inches for print and options in pixels for online use.",
            "If the menu doesn't include the values you want, you can enter them in the boxes to the right of the menu.",
            "If the image also needs straightening, click the straighten icon in the options bar, and your cursor turns into a tiny plus sign.",
            "Now click and drag to draw a line across an area in the image that really should be straight such as this boat ramp.",
            "When you release your mouse button, Photoshop rotates the image.",
            "It's a good idea to have Photoshop hide the cropped pixels instead of delete them so you can change your mind about this crop in the future.",
            "To do that, turn off Delete Crop Pixels in the Options bar.",
            "When everything looks good, click the check mark in the Options bar or press the Return or Enter key on your keyboard to crop the image.",
            "Now choose View, Fit on Screen, to enlarge the image so you can continue editing.",
            "Let's save the work you've done so far by choosing File, Save As, and in the Save AS dialog box, choose Photoshop from the Format or Type menu.",
            "Leave the Layers check box turned on, and then click Save.",
            "Saving in the Photoshop format retains your cropped pixels as well as any layers you add as you continue to work on this photograph.",
            "In fact, it's a good idea to save often while you edit, so at the end of each video in this series, remember to choose File, Save, to update this saved Photoshop document with your new edits.",
            "You'll learn more about options for saving in the last video in this series.",
            "So to recap, in this video, you learned to use the crop tool to improve composition and straighten an image, and you also learned how to save the document in Photoshop format.",
            "In the next video, we'll use adjustment layers to improve this photo's lighting and color."

            "This not only protects your original photograph, it gives you maximum editing flexibility too, as you'll see in this video.",
            "Let's add an adjustment layer to make this image brighter and to add some punch.",
            "Click the half-black, half-white circle at the bottom of your layers panel and choose brightness contrast.",
            "Notice the new adjustment layer in your layers panel and how it's highlighted, which indicates it's active.",
            "The properties panel that opens offers controls for the active adjustment layer.",
            "These controls will affect all the layers below this adjustment layer in the layers panel, which in this case is the photograph on layer zero.",
            "In the properties panel, try clicking the auto button to have Photoshop correct the image for you.",
            "And then adjust the sliders to your liking.",
            "To see a before and after version, click the visibility icon to the left of this adjustment layer in the layers panel.",
            "So here's our before, and here's our after version.",
            "If the adjustment looks too strong, you can use the opacity setting near the top of the layers panel to reduce its strength.",
            "While the image looks a lot better, the colors could stand some boosting.",
            "So let's add a hue saturation adjustment layer, and in the properties drag the saturation slider to the right until the image looks good to you.",
            "Go ahead and close the properties panel by clicking the icon in the upper right.",
            "The image looks even better, though the grassy area and some of the more colorful houses now look a little too vibrant.",
            "To fix that we'll hide the adjustment from those areas using a layer mask which is the white thumbnail that comes with every adjustment layer.",
            "Since this mask is filled with white, the adjustment we made is visible across the entire photo.",
            "However, by adding black to the mask the adjustment can be hidden in those areas.",
            "To hide the adjustment make sure the mask is active, which is indicated by the white brackets on the layer mask thumbnail in the layers panel.",
            "Now grab the brush tool from the tools panel, and in the options bar click the brush preset picker and choose a soft edge brush.",
            "Use the size slider to set the brush tip pixel size to approximately 150 pixels for this image.",
            "Press return or enter on your keyboard to close the brush preset picker.",
            "Now take a peek at the color swatches at the bottom of your tools panel.",
            "The foreground color swatch determines what color the brush tool uses.",
            "When you have a layer mask active, your only choices are white, black, or gray.",
            "So if the foreground color swatch isn't black, go ahead and reset them to their default values by clicking the tiny icon at the upper left of the color chips, and then click the curved arrow to its right to switch them so black is on top.",
            "Now mouse over to your image, and brush across the areas in which you want to hide the adjustment.",
            "You can change brush size as you go using the left and right bracket keys to the right of the P key on your keyboard.",
            "For example, you can tap the right bracket key to increase brush size or the left bracket key to decrease brush size.",
            "If you happen to hide too much of the adjustment-let's say you hid the reflection of the red house in the water-click the curved arrow above the color swatches to switch them so white is on top, and then brush back across that area to reveal the adjustment.",
            "Remember when you're working inside a layer mask, black conceals the adjustment and white reveals it.",
            "To quickly assess the changes you've made to the image, you can compare a before and after version.",
            "To do that, hold down the option key on a Mac or alt in windows as you click the visibility icon to the left of layer zero in your layers panel.",
            "When you do, Photoshop turns off all the other layers.",
            "So here's our before.",
            "And here's our after version.",
            "As you can see, adjustment layers made short work of correcting this image, and the layer masks that come with them let you hide changes from areas that don't need it.",
            "Adjustment layers remain editable too.",
            "For example, to change the color boost, double click the hue saturation adjustment layer thumbnail, and in the properties panel you can adjust the saturation slider.",
            "If you decide you don't like an adjustment layer, you can delete it by making sure it's active in the layers panel and then pressing the delete or backspace key on your keyboard.",
            "Let's resurrect that layer by choosing edit, undo delete layer.",

            ">> In this video, we'll use the Spot Healing Brush and Patch tools to remove unwanted objects in a photo.",
            "Both tools do a great job of blending your retouches with the surrounding area as shown here in this before and after example.",
            "While you can do all of your retouching on the original image layer, I like to retouch on separate layers in order to protect my original image and to increase editing flexibility.",
            "I'll delete the layers I made by tapping the Delete or Backspace key on my keyboard so we can recreate them together.",
            "I'll zoom in to the image by pressing and holding the Cmd key on a Mac or Ctrl in Windows and then tapping the Plus key on my keyboard a few times.",
            "Once zoomed in, you can reposition the image on screen by pressing and holding the Spacebar on your keyboard and then dragging with your mouse.",
            "Let's start with the Spot Healing Brush as it's the easiest to use and it's great for removing small objects like the cows in this pasture and some of the more distracting poles.",
            "Start by creating a new layer by choosing Layer, New, Layer, and enter \"spot healing\" into the Name field and click OK.",
            "Alternatively, you can create a new layer by clicking the New Layer icon at the bottom right of the Layers panel.",
            "In the Tools panel, activate the Spot Healing Brush and in the Options bar, make sure the Content-Aware button is highlighted.",
            "Now turn on Sample All Layers to have Photoshop look through the currently active yet empty layer to layers underneath where the pixels actually live.",
            "Mouse over to your image and make the Brush Size slightly larger than the item you want to remove.",
            "You can tap the Right Bracket key on your keyboard in increase Brush Size or the Left Bracket key to decrease it.",
            "Now put your cursor at the item you want to remove and click.",
            "When you do, Photoshop uses pixels immediately outside the brush cursor to remove the item.",
            "You can also click and drag with this tool.",
            "For example, we can decrease Brush Size even further and then click and drag to remove some of these more distracting poles.",
            "As you can see, Photoshop is doing an incredible job removing these items from the photograph.",
            "Reposition the image again by pressing and holding the Spacebar and then dragging with your mouse so you can see all the distracting items that you need to remove.",
            "Now if you don't like the results of one of the removals, you can always undo it and try again.",
            "So let's choose Edit, Undo Spot Healing Brush, and then let's have another go by using a slightly smaller brush cursor and by making shorter brush strokes.",
            "To remove the boat in the foreground, let's increase Brush Size so the boat fits within the brush cursor and give it a single click.",
            "Reposition the image again.",
            "Now to remove larger items such as this red roof here, you'll get a better result if you tell Photoshop where to copy the pixels from which you can do using the Patch Tool.",
            "So let's begin by adding another new empty layer by choosing Layer, New, Layer.",
            "Let's enter \"patch\" into the Name field and click OK.",
            "In the Tools panel, click and hold your mouse atop the Spot Healing Brush and from the menu that appears, choose Patch Tool.",
            "In the Options bar, set the Patch menu to Content-Aware and then turn on Sample All Layers.",
            "If you don't see the Sample All Layers check box, then you forgot to choose Content-Aware from the Patch menu.",
            "Now click and drag to draw a rough selection around the item you want to remove.",
            "Be sure to make the selection slightly larger than the item itself.",
            "Otherwise, you may end up with a ghostly outline of it.",
            "To tell Photoshop where to copy pixels from, click inside the selection and then drag it to the area in the image you want Photoshop to use for the patch.",
            "When you release your mouse button, Photoshop performs the patch and blends it with surrounding pixels.",
            "While the selection is still active, be sure to experiment with the structure and color fields in the Options bar.",
            "To preserve more of the texture from the area that you copied pixels from, increase the Structure slider.",
            "To preserve less of the texture, decrease it.",
            "To perform more color blending between the two areas, increase the Color slider.",
            "To perform less color blending, decrease it.",
            "When everything looks good, deactivate the selection by choosing Select, Deselect.",
            "Now let's choose View, Fit on Screen, and assess the removals by turning off the visibility of the layers we added in this video.",
            "As you can see, the Spot Healing Brush and Patch Tools did a great job to clean up this image.",
            "I'll turn those layers back on in the same way.",
            "Now choose File, Save to save your document again with these changes.",
            "The Photoshop format preserves your content removal layers so you can continue to edit them in the future.",
            "In the next video, you'll get creative with this image as you learn how to blur parts of it using a filter, how to turn it into a beautiful black and white, and how to add a color tint."

            "We'll use a filter from the blur gallery to apply a fun tilt shift effect to this scene.",
            "We'll employ an adjustment layer to drain the color from the image and then add an artistic color tint.",
            "Let's start by putting all the layers into a protective wrapper called a smart object which enables us to apply an editable filter to all the layers it wants and protect the original photo.",
            "To do that, activate the top-most layer by clicking it and then shift click the bottom-most layer, and Photoshop activates all the layers in between.",
            "Now choose filter, convert for smart filters, and click OK if you see a message.",
            "Photoshop tucks the layer content into the protective wrapper of a smart object so the filter you're about to run happens to the wrapper instead of what's inside.",
            "By the way, you can always access your original layers by double clicking the smart object layers thumbnail in the layers panel.",
            "Now choose filter, blur gallery, tilt shift.",
            "This filter lets you simulate the look of a miniature village in this image.",
            "Here's how it works.",
            "To reposition the filter, drag the black and white pin.",
            "To control blur strength, use the blur slider in the tilt shift panel on the right side of your screen. Drag right to increase the amount of blur or drag left to decrease it.",
            "To control the size of the in-focus area, drag one of the solid lines up or down.",
            "To control the size of the blurry areas, drag one of the dash lines up or down.",
            "To rotate the focus area, drag one of the white circles atop the solid line in a circular motion.",
            "When you're finished, click OK in the options bar at the top of your screen and Photoshop applies the filter.",
            "To experiment with different filter settings, double click the filter's name in the layers panel to reopen it.",
            "If you want to hide the filter effect from part of the image, activate the smart filter mask which is the white thumbnail shown here and then paint with black or gray.",
            "In fact, we did this on an adjustment layer mask in the second video in this series in order to hide part of the adjustment.",
            "To delete a filter, drag the filter's name to the trash icon at the bottom right of the layers panel.",
            "I'll choose edit, undo delete smart filter to bring that filter back.",
            "Another common creative effect is to turn a color photo into black and white which you can do using an adjustment layer.",
            "To do that, click the half-black, half-white circle at the bottom of your layers panel and choose black and white.",
            "In the properties panel that opens, you can use the sliders to adjust the contrast in the image.",
            "For example, to darken the reds in the image, drag the red slider to the left.",
            "To lighten the reds instead, drag the slider to the right.",
            "To add an artistic color tint to the image, turn on the tint check box.",
            "When you do, Photoshop tints the image with light brown creating a sepia effect.",
            "To change the color tint, click the colored square next to the word tint.",
            "In the color picker that opens, click within the vertical bar to choose a range of colors and then click within the larger box to its left to pick a brightness level.",
            "Click OK when you're finished and then close the properties panel.",
            "As long as you've saved the file in Photoshop format, you can experiment with contrast and color tint later on.",
            "To do that, double click the black and white adjustment layers thumbnail in the layers panel and then adjust the settings in the properties panel that opens.",
            "To delete the effect altogether, make sure the black and white adjustment layer is active in your layers panel and then tap the delete or backspace key on your keyboard.",
            "Now choose file, save to save your document in Photoshop format to preserve the changes you made in this video.",
            "So to recap, in this video you learned how to use the tilt shift blur filter safely and how to reopen it to fine tune its settings .",
            "You also learned how to create a black and white image and how to add a custom color tint.",
            "In the next video, you'll learn how to sharpen your masterpiece, save it with all of your layers intact, and how to save it as a .jpeg in order to share it with others."

            "You'll also learn how to save an edited photo into different formats for different uses.",
            "First, let's talk about what sharpening really means.",
            "Sharpening an image in Photoshop is similar to sharpening a kitchen knife.",
            "In both instances you're emphasizing edges.",
            "On a knife it's easy to identify the edge.",
            "It's the side that can cut you.",
            "In a digital image, it's the areas of high contrast where vastly different color pixels meet, such as where a tree meets the sky, or in our case, where red roofs meet white siding and where the lake meets the shore.",
            "To emphasize those edges, Photoshop lightens the light pixels and darkens the dark pixels.",
            "There are many ways to sharpen an image in Photoshop, though in this video we'll use the smart sharpen filter because it's quick and easy to use.",
            "The first step is to prepare your layers for use with smart filters, which we did in the previous video in this series.",
            "Since you can run multiple filters on a single smart object, we're all set.",
            "So choose filter, sharpen, smart sharpen.",
            "In the dialogue box that opens, you see a preview of the image on the left and controls for sharpening on the right.",
            "To enlarge the preview, drag the lower right corner of the dialogue box.",
            "Next use the zoom tools beneath the image preview to set your document zoom level to 100% so you can see an accurate sharpening preview.",
            "Now click and drag within the preview box to bring an important part of the image into view.",
            "Set the preset menu to default, and then adjust the sliders to your liking.",
            "The first slider we'll adjust is radius, which tells Photoshop how many pixels on either side of the high contrast edge pixels to emphasize.",
            "You can think of this setting as sharpening width.",
            "The higher the number, the more obvious the sharpening.",
            "For the best results, keep this setting low.",
            "Next with the amount slider at 200%, drag it slowly leftward until the sharpening looks good to you.",
            "If you see any speckled flakes appear in the image, drag the reduce noise slider to the right to get rid of them.",
            "When everything looks good, click OK and Photoshop sharpens the image.",
            "To reopen the filter and change its settings, double click the filter's name in the layers panel.",
            "To hide both the smart sharpen filter and the blur filter for parts of your image, you can activate the smart filter mask, which is the white thumbnail shown here, and then paint with black or gray.",
            "We did that on an adjustment layer mask on the second video in this series in order to hide part of the adjustment.",
            "To delete the filter, drag the filter's name to the trash icon at the bottom right of the layers panel.",
            "In order to preserve your layers and filters so you can edit them in the future, be sure to save the document in Photoshop format.",
            "To do that, choose file, save as, and from the format or type menu choose Photoshop.",
            "Leave the layers check box turned on and click save.",
            "In order to share the image with other people who don't have Photoshop, to post it on the Web or submit to a printing service, you need to save it in a different format.",
            "So choose file, save as, and this time choose .jpeg from the format or type menu, which is a great format for a full color photograph, such as the one we're working with here.",
            "Go ahead and rename the file so you don't overwrite your sample file.",
            "And click save.",
            "In the .jpeg options dialogue box, you can set the quality of the image.",
            "The higher the quality, the larger the file size.",
            "The lower the quality, the smaller the file size.",
            "I'll set the quality menu to medium, which is great for posting the image online or for emailing.",
            "If, however, the image will be printed, be sure to enter 12 into the quality field for the highest possible quality.",
            "And click OK.",
            "Of course, the techniques shown in this video series only touch the tip of the iceberg of what's possible in Photoshop.",
            "It's worth mentioning that Photoshop pairs beautifully with other Adobe apps, such as the image organizing, editing, and sharing powerhouse Photoshop Lightroom, as well as mobile apps such as Adobe Mix for combining imagery into your own artistic vision and Adobe Fix for applying quick edits to your mobile photos before bringing them into Photoshop for more heavy-duty retouching.",
            "I hope you've enjoyed this video series, and I encourage you to explore the myriad tutorials in the Learn Library on adobe.com so you can learn how to turn the image you have to the image you want."

            "If you are following along, download the Flyer template from the Tutorial page.",
            "You can use that template and the skills you learned here, to make flyers for all kinds of events, like fundraisers, parties, and more.",
            "In Photoshop, choose File, Open, and navigate to the supplied template file.",
            "Select it and click Open.",
            "As you work on a project in Photoshop, it's a good idea to use layers, putting each object on its own layer so you can work on that object separately.",
            "This document starts with one layer that's called the Background layer.",
            "To make a new layer, choose Layer, New, Layer.",
            "Name this layer \"Salmon\" since you'll be making a graphic on this layer that looks like a piece of salmon sushi.",
            "In Photoshop, it's a really good idea to name your layers to stay organized.",
            "Click OK, and a new layer is added to the Layers panel.",
            "To start the sushi graphic, select the Rectangular Marquee Tool and drag in the image to make a selection.",
            "The area inside these dotted lines is called a selection, and a selection lets you isolate an area to work on.",
            "Now you'll fill that selection with an orange color.",
            "Make sure the Salmon layer is highlighted in the Layers panel, because you want the orange color to be on that layer.",
            "In Photoshop, it's always a good idea to make sure you're working on the correct layer.",
            "In the Swatches panel, select an Orange Color Swatch.",
            "That orange color appears in the color box over here at the bottom of the Tools panel.",
            "This is called the foreground color.",
            "Choose Edit, Fill.",
            "Select Foreground Color from the Contents menu, and click OK.",
            "Now choose Select, Deselect, to remove the selection.",
            "It's always a good idea to deselect when you're done with a selection in Photoshop.",
            "Now you'll make another layer for seaweed, using the same method.",
            "Choose Layer, New, Layer.",
            "Name the new layer \"Seaweed\" and click OK.",
            "With the Rectangular Marquee Tool still selected, make a selection that looks like this.",

            "Make sure Foreground Color is chosen, and click OK.",

            "Make sure the Seaweed layer is highlighted in the Layers panel.",
            "Select the Move Tool, and drag in the image to position the seaweed rectangle in the center.",
            "Magenta Smart Guides may appear to help you align the center.",
            "Now we will add this text to our flyer.",
            "Select the Horizontal Type Tool.",
            "In the Tool Options bar up here, click the arrow to the right of the Font-Family menu, and choose a font.",
            "The samples on the right side of the menu give you an idea of what the font will look like.",
            "Now the fonts in your menu may be different than mine, so just pick any font you have.",
            "Click the arrow to the right of the Font Size menu up here in the Options bar, and choose a large size, so you can be sure to see the text on the image initially.",
            "As you can see up here, there are a lot of other options for formatting your type.",
            "In the Options bar, click the Color field to open the Color Picker dialog.",
            "Move the pointer over the light grey part of the image and click to sample that light grey.",
            "This is a good tip for choosing a text color that matches the color found on an image.",
            "Click OK in the Color Picker.",
            "Click on the Seaweed in your image, and in capital letters, type \"SUSHI.\"",
            "Press Return or Enter, type \"MAKING.\" Press Return or Enter, type \"CLASS.\"",
            "Once more, press Return or Enter, and type \"7 PM.\" Select the text by dragging over it.",
            "And up here in the Options bar, click the Center Text icon to center all the lines that are typed with each other.",
            "Select the Move Tool and move the text into position, using the Smart Guides that appear, to line it up at the center.",
            "Okay, let's save what we've built so far.",
            "Choose File, Save As.",
            "In the Save As dialog box, change the name of the file.",
            "Save it in a Photoshop Format to keep all the layers you've added so you can back and edit them in the future.",
            "Then click Save to save the flyer.",
            "Then click OK.",
            "The flyer we built so far is pretty simple, but you can take it further.",
            "Here is a version of this flyer with more details.",
            "Every element was made using skills you have learned in this tutorial.",

            "To start your project, you can use the sample images available for download on the tutorial page or photos of your own.",
            "You can also use Adobe mobile apps, like Lightroom for Mobile, to capture and edit photos on your smartphone or tablet and bring them into Photoshop.",
            "Just be sure to use full resolution photos so they print well at poster size.",
            "If you're having your posters printed by a third party service, consult them about poster dimensions and resolution.",
            "To open an image for your poster, choose File, Open, and navigate to an image.",
            "Select it and click Open.",
            "In order to create several versions of the poster, we'll use artboards.",
            "Artboards let you create multiple layouts with different content or in different sizes in a single document, and you can see them all at once.",
            "We'll start by creating an artboard for this image.",
            "Select the background image layer in the Layers panel and choose Layer, New, Artboard from Layers.",
            "Name the artboard Leaf and click Okay.",
            "A new artboard is created that's the size of the image.",
            "Now we'll add some text to the poster design.",
            "Select the Horizontal Type tool.",
            "Go to the Tool Options bar up here and select the size.",
            "Type in a larger value, and press Enter or Return.",
            "Click anywhere in your design, and in capital letters enter a few lines of text pressing Enter or Return between each line.",
            "Select that text by clicking and dragging over it.",

            "Choose a font from the menu here picking any font you have.",
            "I chose a Typekit font that comes with my Creative Cloud subscription.",

            "You'll learn basic photo editing skills using Adjustment Layers that can be applied to editing photographs for any purpose in Photoshop.",
            "To start your project, you can use the sample images available for download on the tutorial page or a few photos of your own.",
            "To open your files, choose File, Open.",
            "Select multiple images by clicking the first image then pressing the shift key and clicking the last.",
            "Click Open.",
            "Click the tab at the top of the tangerine.jpeg image to show it if you need to.",
            "As you can see, this image is a bit dull.",
            "There are lots of ways to improve the appearance of images so they're more to our liking in Photoshop or in Photoshop Lightroom.",
            "I'll show you a few tips for improving your photos in Photoshop.",
            "With the image layer selected in the Layers panel, open the Adjustments panel by clicking the Adjustments tab.",
            "If you don't see it, you can choose Window, Adjustments.",
            "There are lots of Adjustment Layers to choose from, like Color Balance to fine tune color or Black & White to convert a color photo to a black and white photo.",
            "This image needs to be a bit brighter to make it pop, so we'll add a Brightness Contrast Adjustment Layer.",
            "Click the Brightness Contrast button here to add a new layer to the Layers panel called an Adjustment Layer.",
            "The Properties panel also opens, and it's where you'll find the controls for this Adjustment Layer.",
            "With Adjustment Layers, you can change the appearance of a photo, like brightness and contrast, without actually changing the underlying photo itself, and your changes remain editable.",
            "Now let's improve the brightness of the photo.",
            "In the Properties panel, drag the Brightness slider to the right to increase the overall brightness of the image.",
            "We can also adjust the look of an image with more than one Adjustment Layer.",
            "We can choose from any of these different types of Adjustment Layers depending on what we need for our image.",
            "Next we'll add a Hue Saturation Adjustment Layer to change the image by adjusting its color.",
            "In the Adjustments Panel, click the Hue Saturation button.",
            "In the Layers Panel, a Hue Saturation Adjustment Layer is created above the last selected layer.",
            "The Properties panel now shows controls for this Adjustment Layer.",
            "Drag the Saturation slider to the right of it.",
            "The further you drag, the more saturated or intense the colors become in the image.",
            "When you like what you see, click the Properties panel tab to close the Properties panel.",
            "I want to make the same adjustments to the other images as well to create a uniform look across them.",
            "Photoshop lets you drag the Adjustment Layers between documents to copy them.",
            "First we need to see all the images at once.",
            "To do that, choose Window, Arrange, 3-up Stacked.",
            "Click in the tangerine image, and you'll see the Adjustment Layers in the Layers panel.",
            "These photos were all take in the same place under the same light, so we can use the adjustments we made on one of these photos on the other photos to give them a uniform look in our project.",
            "If you have photos taken at different times in different lighting, each photo may need different adjustments.",
            "Click one Adjustment Layer and shift click the other in the Layers panel to select both.",
            "Drag from the Layer name or thumbnail, not this white box called a mask, into another image.",
            "When you see an outline, release the mouse to copy the Adjustment Layers into the image.",
            "Drag the Adjustment Layers to the third image as well.",
            "Each image now has the same adjustments applied as the tangerine image.",
            "Since we used Adjustment Layers, we can now fine tune each image separately if we need.",
            "Switch to the lemon.jpeg by clicking in that image.",
            "This photo is a bit too bright.",
            "In the Layers panel, double click the Layer thumbnail to the left of the Brightness Contrast Layer to edit the settings in the Properties panel again.",
            "Adjust the brightness of the lemon image by dragging the slider, and then click the Properties panel tab to hide it.",
            "Let's gather the images into a single window again just so we can focus on the lemon.",
            "Choose Window, Arrange, Consolidate All to Tabs.",
            "If the lemon image isn't showing, click the lemon.jpeg tab to display that image.",
            "Using Adjustment Layers like this is one option of many in Photoshop for polishing your photos for use in a project.",
            "There are lots of other things you can do to improve photos like these including making corrections on an image-by-image basis.",
            "For example, I notice that this particular photo has a smudge in the background.",
            "So I'll select the spot healing brush tool in the Tools panel.",
            "In the Layers panel, I'll click the lock icon in the Background Layer just so I can make a change to this layer.",
            "Then I'll drag across the dirt smudge on this image to remove it.",
            "With some basic adjustments and edits, we made these photos look better.",
            "But there's so much more in Photoshop you can do.",

            "So I can use it on the front page of my website.",
            "Here's how we can add type.",
            "First, come to the Horizontal Type Tool in the toolbar.",
            "If you click and hold down, you can select the Horizontal or Vertical Type Tools.",
            "The Vertical Type Tool is used to add vertical text, like Japanese text for instance.",
            "In this image, I want my type to be horizontal.",
            "So I'll select the Horizontal Type Tool.",
            "From here, you can then add text in two ways.",
            "You can click and start typing anywhere in your image or you can define a shape that constraints your text.",
            "So that we can see the text we type in, let's first change the font size, up here in the Options bar.",
            "Select the Font Size and type in a font size for your text.",
            "I'll type in 155 and then press Enter or Return.",
            "Click in a part of your image and start typing.",
            "This is called Point Type.",
            "For the purposes of trying out text on this image, I'm just using the default font, but I'll fine-tune this later for sure.",
            "When using Point Type with the Horizontal Type Tool, the text expands horizontally from where you clicked.",
            "To move the text where you need it in your design, you can move the cursor away from the text and when a pointer appears, just click and drag.",
            "Up here in the Options bar, click the Check mark, or you can press Command + Return or Control + Return to finish working on this text.",
            "Next, I'll show you another way to add text and then I'll show you how to format that text.",
            "Say I've got a poster and I want the text to be contained in a certain area.",
            "You can click and drag to defining area to type in to.",
            "Before we start typing, let's change the font size of the text, just so it looks a little bit better by choosing a smaller size up here, in the Options bar.",
            "Any text I type in will wrap inside this boundary.",
            "This type of text is called Area Type.",
            "I'd really like this text to wrap to two lines in a certain way.",
            "We can easily resize the text area to do this.",
            "Click and drag one of the handles you see to resize the text box.",
            "To move this type of text where you need it in your design, you can move the cursor away from the text, when a pointer appears, just click and drag.",
            "When you're done and you want to move on, you can click the Check mark in the Options bar, or press Command and Return or Control and Return to finish working on this text.",
            "Now that you've got some text in your image, what if you want to change the way it looks?",
            "With the Horizontal Type Tool selected, you can click directly on text and then drag across to select it.",
            "You can then change Type formatting options up here in the Options bar.",
            "You can select a font... change the style, change the size.",
            "Click here to change the color.",
            "Click to sample the color and then click OK.",
            "I'll drag the text over, so it looks a little better.",
            "Here's a tip.",
            "Suppose I had another tool like this Move Tool selected, and I needed to select some text, when you create text in Photoshop, a Type Layer is created in the Layers panel.",
            "Another way to select your text is to double click the T in the Layers panel.",
            "This will select the text in your Photoshop file.",
            "You can then make any text formatting changes you want, like changing the color... or changing the font.",

            ">> In this video, you'll learn how to refine the Type in your design by modifying Type.",
            "Some of the aspects of Type that make great design include attention to the spacing between characters and lines, the style of your text, and the use of special characters called Glyphs.",
            "These factors and more make for great design.",
            "In Photoshop, you can easily make basic edits to your text, such as color, size, font, and more.",
            "Let's make some edits to text.",
            "With the Horizontal Type Tool selected, click on text, then drag across your text to select it.",
            "Open the Character panel here, you will see some of the same options as in the Options bar up here, but there are so many more ways to refine the text such as spacing between letters, spacing between lines, all caps, and so much more.",
            "As I look at my Type, I like the font.",
            "But I'd like to experiment with other Type formatting options and see if I can make the text a little bit easier to read with more air.",
            "I want to see how it looks in all caps.",
            "I can do that by clicking the All Caps button, here in the Character panel.",
            "I could also make the Type small caps, all underline, and a lot more.",
            "To add more space between the letters, you can add tracking.",
            "In the Character panel, you'll see the tracking option here.",
            "Adjust the Tracking Value, a positive value spreads the characters apart, and a negative value brings them closer together.",
            "There, I like that, that's much easier to read.",
            "I also think there could be more space between the lines of text, so they are more easily readable.",
            "This is called Leading and can be found here.",
            "I'll apply some leading until the lines of text are more readable.",
            "If I really want to make this banner unique, I can customize characters with Glyphs.",
            "A recent feature added, you might not know about, is the Glyphs panel.",
            "Glyphs are graphic shapes that represent a character, like a copyright symbol for instance, or part of a character.",
            "Let's explore Glyphs in the Glyphs panel.",
            "But first I'll click the Check mark in the Options bar to finish editing the selected text.",
            "Then with the Horizontal Type Tool selected, I'll click in some other text.",
            "Open the Glyphs panel by choosing Window, Glyphs.",
            "Here you can see all of the available Glyphs at a chosen font.",
            "You can view alternates for currently selected Glyphs, and access commonly used Glyphs.",
            "If I choose this Symbols category for instance, I can see a lot of commonly used symbols like copyrights, bullets, numbers, and so much more.",
            "To add one to your text, you can simply Double Click() on the Glyph.",
            "I'll choose the entire font category again to see all of the Glyphs for this font.",
            "I'll select a different Glyph for this character I select, to give it a little bit of flourish.",
            "This creates a completely unique look for my image.",
            "By the way, this little square indicates there are extra Glyphs for a character.",
            "Another recent feature is the Glyphs In Context menu, which makes it even easier for you to work with Glyphs.",
            "If you select a character with the Horizontal Type Tool, and hover over that character, the Photoshop Glyphs In Context Menu shows you alternate Glyphs available for that character, right on the canvas.",
            "Now you know how to refine the typography in your design by using Glyphs and modifying spacing.",

            "Here's a screenshot I took of a website, but I could use any photo I have including those I took when I was out and about.",
            "I'm gonna try to identify the font in this screenshot.",
            "I could try finding this font in my existing fonts I already have in Photoshop by looking through them.",
            "But I've got thousands installed and it could take me a very long time.",
            "Instead, if I have a photo with a Latin font like English, we can use the new Match Font feature in Photoshop to identify the font in the photo.",
            "First, open the image in Photoshop.",
            "Select the Rectangular Marquee Tool and drag to select the region of the image that contains the text.",
            "Choose Type, Match Font.",
            "Photoshop shows me the possible fonts that are a match that I already have installed on my machine.",
            "And it searches the Typekit Library and identifies the fonts that are available to your Creative Cloud subscription level.",
            "So that even if you don't have the font installed, you can click the Cloud icon in the Match Font dialog box, which will sync the font to your machine.",
            "To use this, crop tightly on the text that you want to identify, and notice that you can adjust or move your selection to a different part of the photo or screenshot to identify other fonts.",
            "I like all the fonts in this, but here's the one I'm really interested in finding.",
            "I'll select Abolition Soft and click OK.",
            "Now I'm gonna use the font identified by Photoshop, Abolition Soft, in the design I'm working on right now.",
            "There, I think this font works well in this design.",
            "Now in case you'd like to keep exploring, I'll show how to use another cool new feature in Photoshop that helps you find similar fonts and see how they look directly in your design.",
            "To find a similar font, select the Horizontal Type Tool, click in some text and then drag across the selected.",
            "I want to see if there is similar font that has a lighter feel to it.",
            "With the text selected, click the Font Family menu up here, to show the fonts available to you.",
            "In the menu, click here to see a listing of fonts similar to this one.",
            "After looking through the list of fonts that appears, I'll choose this one because it has the look and feel of the original, but it's a little bit lighter and weighting better matches my design.",

            ">> In this series of short videos, we'll explore how to use Photoshop compositing techniques to create a multilayered image of a dream like ocean scene.",
            "We'll be using layers, layer masks, smart objects, and blending techniques to build this composite from the ground up.",
            "The first step in creating a composite is to add a new image.",
            "I already have a couple of images open in Photoshop, and I want to add a more colorful sky to the shot of the pier. I'll go over to the photo of the sunset sky, and I'll select the entire image.",
            "Then I'll copy that, and go back over to the main image of the pier, and paste, which adds the sunset sky as a new layer.",
            "In the Layers Panel, I'll double click on the layer name and rename it Sunset Sky.",
            "I want to be able to see both the new sky layer and the background image at the same time.",
            "So I'll get the Move tool in the Tools panel, then click Opacity at the top of the Layers Panel, and lower the opacity of the sunset layer.",
            "I'll move the new sky layer up until the horizon line on that layer is just a bit below the horizon line on the underlying pier image.",
            "Then I'll set the layer opacity slider back to 100 percent.",
            "Next, I want to hide the lower part of the sunset sky layer, so that we can see the pier and the ocean in the background image. I'll do that with a Layer Mask, which is a tool that you'll use often in your own composites.",
            "I'll click the Add Layer Mask button at the bottom of the Layers Panel to add a layer mask to the active layer.",
            "I'll choose the Gradient tool in the Tools Panel, and in the options bar of this tool, I'll open the Gradient Picker and I'll choose the third gradient swatch from the left, which is a black to white gradient.",
            "I'll leave the rest of the options set to the defaults.",
            "With the Gradient tool, I'll click right up the horizon of the sunset sky layer and drag upwards just a bit.",
            "When I release the mouse, the gradient is added to the layer mask.",
            "Creating a convincing blend, for the new sky.",
            "To understand how a layer mask works, notice the gradient on the layer mask thumbnail.",
            "The black part of the gradient is hiding the sunset sky layer, so that you can see down through that area, to the image of the pier below.",
            "And the white part of the gradient shows the sunset sky layer.",
            "The Gradient Tool created shades and grey in between black and white, which creates a gradual transition from the pier image to the sunset sky.",
            "Next, we'll add an element to the pier that will enhance the story of this image.",
            "This time, I'll use another method to add an image.",
            "File Place.",
            "This method creates a smart object layer, which will allow me to resize and reshape the new image multiple times, without compromising its quality.",
            "To do this, I'll choose File, Place Embedded.",
            "In my folder of source images, I'll choose North.jpg and click Place.",
            "The file is added with a bounding box around it, which you can use to scale or transform the layer if needed.",
            "First, I'll go to the Layers Panel, and I'll change the blending mode of the layer to Overlay.",
            "Since that's what we'll use to blend this image into the pier.",
            "To scale the image smaller, I'll hold down Shift and drag inward on the handle in the upper right corner.",
            "The Shift key preserves the proportions of the original photo.",
            "If I add in the Option or Alt key, it will transform from the centre point.",
            "There, that's look about right.",
            "I'll click the check mark in the Options bar to apply that transformation.",
            "This symbol on the new place layer means that this is a smart object.",
            "You can resize and transform a smart object as many times as you like, without harming the image.",
            "Next, I'll apply some prospective transformations to this layer.",
            "I'll choose Edit, Transform, Distort.",
            "And I'll drag on the top right corner handle and place it close to the top right corner of the pier.",
            "I'll do the same with the top left corner handle.",
            "I'll work with some of the other handles to fine tune the transformation.",
            "So it looks as if this element is really part of the pier.",
            "To apply the transformation, I'll click the check mark button in the Options bar.",
            "There are still some edges showing on the North layer.",
            "So I'll hide them using another layer mask.",

            "That's working nicely for the clouds over the door, but I also want to create a stronger color look that uses both the yellow-orange as well as the purple hues in the sunset.",

            "Let's add some new elements to make it even more dream like and surreal.",
            "Along the way, we'll explore some more layer masking, and use the Blend If sliders for a masking effect.",
            "I'll choose File, Place Embedded, select the Clouds for Pier.jpg file, and then click Place.",
            "I'll lower the opacity a bit, so I can see the clouds in relation to the underlying layers.",
            "I'll drag the layer down a bit, until the centre pillar of clouds is arranged within the arched opening of the doorway.",
            "I'll press Enter or click the check mark button in the Options bar to place the layer.",
            "Then I'll return the layer opacity to 100 percent.",
            "I only want some of the clouds to show up around the pier, and a layer mask will allow me to create this effect.",
            "I'll start with the layer mask that hides the entire layer and then use the Brush tool to reveal the clouds where I want to see them.",
            "I can add a layer mask that's filled with black to hide the Clouds for Pier layer by Option or Alt + Clicking the Add Layer Mask button at the bottom of the Layers panel.",
            "Next, I'll go to the Tools panel and make the Brush tool active.",
            "I'll tap the Right Bracket key a few times to make my brush size larger.",
            "And I'll also make sure that white is my foreground color.",
            "In the Options bar, I'll make sure that the opacity is set to 100 percent.",
            "I'll use a large soft edge brush and paint on the layer mask with white on either side of the pier to reveal the clouds.",
            "I'll tap the left bracket key to make the brush size a bit smaller and add in some clouds at the end of the pier.",
            "Then I'll press X to exchange the colors, so that the foreground color is black.",
            "In the Options bar, I'll lower the brush opacity to 30 percent, and then paint on the mask to gradually hide parts of the layer where I don't want the clouds to show.",
            "With this type of masking, there can be a lot of back and forth with the Brush tool, until you get it looking the way you want.",
            "The great thing about working with layer masks is that the process is very flexible.",
            "Nothing on the Image layer is ever deleted and you can always modify the mask to refine the blending effect further.",
            "Now, we'll add another important part of the story.",
            "I'll choose File, Place Embedded, and choose the Sailboat.jpg image, and click Place.",
            "For this element, I'm not going to resize it.",

            "And to do this, we'll use the technique that's different from a layer mask.",
            "I'll go to the main Layer Menu and I'll choose Layer Style, Blending Options.",
            "Near the bottom of the Layer Style dialog are the Blend If sliders.",
            "These allow you to show or hide parts of the layer based on their brightness value.",
            "To hide the lighter parts of the Sailboat layer, I'll move the highlight slider for this layer towards the left.",
            "Until the number on the right above the slider shows about 135.",
            "This hides the pixels on the boat layer that are brighter than level 135, such as the lighter areas around the sailboat, letting the underlying layers show through.",
            "Next, I'll Option or Alt + Click on the right half of the slider to split it apart.",
            "And I'll bring that half back to the right to about 170.",
            "This creates a more gradual transition between what is being shown and hidden on the layer.",
            "The numbers mean that any tonal value brighter than 170 will be hidden on the layer.",
            "Then there will be a gradual transition to level 135 and any tonal value below that level will be visible.",
            "I like to think of the Blend If sliders as masking without a mask.",
            "In some situations, they can be highly useful compositing tools.",
            "I'll click OK to apply that effect.",
            "The boat is now blended very well, but there are some minor touchups on the outer parts of the boat layer that will require a simple layer mask.",
            "I'll add a Layer Mask, press X to switch the foreground color to black, and then use a soft edge Brush tool to paint with black to hide the edges of the layer.",
            "I'll use the Move tool to reposition the Boat layer, so it's centered in relation to the pier and the doorway.",

            "Here are few photos I took the other day when I was out and about.",
            "I'm going to try to identify the font in this photo.",
            "I could try finding this font in my existing fonts I already have in Photoshop by looking through them, but I've got thousands installed and it could take me a very long time.",
            "Instead, if I have a photo with a Latin font like English, we can use to new Match Font feature in Photoshop to identify the font in a photo.",
            "To get started, open the image in Photoshop, select the Rectangular Marquee Tool in the Toolbar, and drag to select the region of the image that contains the text.",
            "Then choose Type, Match Font.",
            "Photoshop shows me the possible fonts that are matched that I already have installed on my machine, and it searches the Typekit library and identifies fonts that are available to your Creative Cloud subscription level so that even if you don't have the font installed, you can click this little Cloud icon in the Match Font dialogue box, which will sync the font your machine.",
            "To use this, crop tightly on the text you want to identify and notice that you can adjust or move your selection to a different part of the image to identify other fonts.",
            "I'll select this Quimby font I have and click OK.",
            "Now, I'll use the font identified by Photoshop, Quimby, to add some text to this design.",
            "There, I think this font works well.",
            "Now you know how to find fonts in Photoshop CC using Match Font.",

            "One of the most difficult things to do when you're photographing a group of people is to get them all to smile in the same frame.",
            "So if you can't get everyone smiling, just make sure that you have everyone smiling in at least one shot.",
            "They don't all have to be smiling in the same shot, but just make sure that you have everyone smiling so that you can combine the images.",
            "We're going to start with these 2 images, and I'll select Tools and then Photoshop, and we're going to load these 2 images into Photoshop layers.",
            "Bridge will hand those off to Photoshop, and you can see that they're both opened into a single document.",
            "But there's a little bit of a problem here.",
            "If we toggle on and off the layers, you can see that the zoom on the camera was changed between these exposures.",
            "So I need to auto-align these 2 exposures.",
            "On the Layers panel, I will select both of the layers and then I will choose Edit and then Auto-Align Layers.",
            "We'll pick Auto and click OK, and now we can see that Photoshop has automatically aligned those layers so now the people are the same size in both images.",
            "So taking a look at this top image here, everyone looks great except for the girl who has her eyes closed.",
            "If we hide that layer, we can see in the bottom image, well, he's got his tongue out and she's looking away, and the baby is kind of falling a little bit, sliding down, but she looks great.",
            "Now to me, this just makes more sense.",
            "Since this is the bad image, I actually want to put it on top.",
            "The good image here, this is kind of my base layer, because everyone looks good and then I just need to fix her.",
            "So I'm going to drag it to reposition the stacking order on the Layers panel.",
            "So now my good layer is on the bottom, everyone except for her.",
            "And then all I need to do is paint out everyone except for her.",
            "And I don't even need to physically paint that out.",
            "I can hold down the Option key and then click on the mask icon, and that will add a black layer, which will hide everyone.",
            "Then all I need to do is tap the B key to select the Brush tool, tap the D key to make sure that I have the default colors- that puts white as my foreground color- and make sure that I'm painting with 100% opacity.",
            "Then I'll zoom in using Command+ or Control+ on Windows, and I'll paint right over her face here with white, which basically means I'm revealing this portion of the image, and this is the good portion of the image where she's smiling.",
            "So I will just be a little careful as I paint in this area.",
            "Now, I'm going to paint a little too far just to show you what might happen, because when you are using this technique you definitely want to toggle the eye icon on and off to check the mask that you just created.",
            "So you can see, for example, on this shoulder I have a little bit of a problem.",
            "So we'll zoom in even more and then use the space bar to scoot over.",
            "And let's see what that problem is.",
            "I've actually painted away his shoulder.",
            "So I want to tap the X key in order to exchange my foreground and background color.",
            "I'll get a little smaller brush using the left bracket key.",
            "And then I just want to bring the shoulder back right here.",
            "All right.",
            "Let's toggle the visibility again and see if I have any other areas that need to be fixed.",
            "I'm going to scroll down and see.",
            "I'll just make sure.",
            "No, I've got a big issue right here.",
            "In this image I've got the nice sleeve here, but then I've got something odd happening in this layer.",
            "So again, with this same color selected, with black selected, I need to paint out this area from the topmost image.",
            "Now we'll toggle that on and off again just to double check.",
            "We can see a little bit more right here, so I just want to remove that.",
            "And one more time, and that's looking good.",
            "So there you have it, a simple way for combining multiple images together to create that perfect image where everyone looks good at the same time."

            "In this video, I'll take you through the process of creating that artwork which you can see here and show you some great ways to be more efficient in Photoshop as you design.",
            "I've started my project by opening an image file and adding an artboard to the file by choosing Layer, New, Artboard from Layers.",
            "In this case, artboards will let me try our different design ideas in the same file.",
            "Now I'd like to add a design element to make some text that I'll add pop.",
            "I'll make a new layer in the Layers panel to this contain new artwork and make it easily editable later on.",
            "Using the Stamp Tool over here in the Tools panel, I'll just copy a bit of the original image onto the new layer.",
            "Using the Move Tool, I'll drag the selected layer content up a bit so you can see the difference.",
            "Next, I'll add some type to the design.",
            "I created some type earlier and will simply show the type layers in Layers panel over here.",
            "I'll select the text and make a quick text formatting change.",
            "You can also choose glyphs alternates for a selection right on the canvas to help save time.",
            "I'll select the letter C in clouds and choose a canvas glyph alternate that appears in this menu.",
            "With the artwork finished, I want to able to save it and reuse it elsewhere.",
            "I can easily do this with Creative Cloud Libraries, which allow you to access, organize, and share your design assets.",
            "You can even organize design assets into multiple Creative Cloud Libraries.",
            "These Libraries may be based on projects or even types of assets for instance.",
            "One way to add assets to a Creative Cloud library is to select layers you want to save in the Layers panel, like these image layers, then drag them right into the Libraries panel to save the content and even rename it.",
            "I'll also select the text and drag that content to the Libraries panel as well and change the name.",
            "With the few assets saved in my default library, I can easily share any of them with the members of band, for instance so they can add this design content to stickers, posters and whatever else they need.",
            "Right clicking on an asset, you can choose Share Link.",
            "You can then create a public link that lets anyone with the link download a copy of the selected assets.",
            "And once downloaded, they'll be able to edit the contents independently of your original.",
            "I'd like to add the artwork that I saved to a mockup of a T-shirt just to an idea of what it may look like.",
            "This calls for another artboard.",
            "You can make a new artboard by selecting the Artboard Tool over in the Tools panel and drawing an artboard or selecting a size and clicking Add New Artboard.",
            "I've created another library for a different project I'm working on and I'd like to use this T-shirt image in this project.",
            "I'll drag the image onto the artboard, resize and reposition it a bit, then click this checkmark in the Options bar to finish.",
            "I'll switch back to the original library I had and drag the text I saved onto your artboard.",
            "By default, library assets that are dragged from the Libraries panel are linked to the original library item.",
            "When an original asset is modified like this, all the project files using the linked asset will be updated to the latest version.",
            "As a last step for this project, I'll crop the artwork down to the correct album size I need.",
            "I'll start by zooming in a bit to the album artwork Artboard.",
            "I can then click the album artboard name to select it and change the size in the Options bar up here.",
            "I'll fit the artwork in the window so it's easier to see.",
            "Finally, I'll select the layers in the Layers panel.",
            "Then I'll drag the artwork with the Move Tool into the center of the artboard and take a look at my completed artwork.",
            "In Photoshop CC, there are many other features that allow you to work more efficiently as you design.",

            "In this video, we'll explore how to undo, redo, and step back in time as you're editing.",
            "You can follow along with this file from the practice files for this tutorial, or an image of your own.",
            "Let's start by making some paint strokes on this image.",
            "Select the Brush tool in the Tools panel, then go over to the Swatches panel, and click on a color there.",
            "You can use any color that you like.",
            "Move into the image and make a brush stroke.",
            "By the way, if your brush tip isn't big enough, go up to the Options bar for the Brush tool, click on the Brush Picker and set the Size there.",
            "I'll click off of that picker to close it.",
            "Let's make a couple more strokes.",
            "Go to the Swatches panel again, select another color and stroke.",
            "And let's do that one more time.",
            "So, let's say that you want to get rid of the last action that you did in Photoshop CC, in this case making that pink stroke.",
            "The quick way to do that is to use a keyboard shortcut, Command + Z on a Mac or Ctrl + Z on Windows.",
            "Which I'll do now.",
            "And the pink stroke goes away.",
            "I can bring it back, by pressing Command + Z again, or Ctrl + Z again.",
            "So, that keyboard shortcut is a toggle for undoing and redoing the last action that you took.",
            "If you prefer to use a menu command rather than the shortcut, you can go up to the Edit menu, and there you can choose Undo Brush Tool, and Photoshop CC even tells you what action you're going to undo.",
            "And then Edit, and Redo Brush Tool.",
            "Now what if you want to undo more than just one step?",
            "In that case, go up to the Edit menu, and this time choose Step Backward.",
            "And you can do that up to 50 times by default.",
            "And each time you're stepping back one action, one step in time.",
            "Similarly, you can step forward one step at a time.",
            "Edit, Step Forward.",
            "Edit, Step Forward.",
            "Edit, Step Forward.",
            "There's one more way that you can step through time in Photoshop CC.",
            "And that's using the History panel.",
            "The History panel is located here, in this collapsed column of panels.",
            "If you don't see it, go up to the Window menu and choose History.",
            "I'm going to expand this panel by moving down to its bottom bar, until I see a double pointed arrow and then dragging down.",
            "So, what we see in this panel, is a separate bar for each action that I just took on this image.",
            "Open and then three strokes with the Brush Tool.",
            "Keep your eye on the panel as I make another stroke.",
            "My fourth stroke was just recorded in the History panel too.",
            "Now let's use another tool to see how it's recorded.",
            "Go to the Tools panel, and this time select the Dodge tool, which is used to make things lighter.",
            "The Dodge tool also has a brush tip, just like the brush tool.",
            "To make the Dodge tool tip bigger, go up to the Options bar for this tool, and there you have a Size slider that you can drag.",
            "And then click in a blank area to close the Brush Picker.",
            "Now come into the image, and let's drag over the leaf a couple times.",
            "Each time I release my mouse and then drag again, another Dodge tool state is recorded here in the History panel.",
            "The beauty of having these states in the History panel, is that you can step back through them, one by one, like this.",
            "Or you can jump to a particular state, like this.",
            "And each time you do that, everything in the image changes to the way it looked at that state, at that point in time.",
            "You also can step forward or jump forward in time, in the History panel, like this.",
            "Two things to keep in mind about the History panel: if you do go back to a previous state, - let's go back here - and then you do something else, let's say I dodge in this area of the image.",
            "Keep your eye on the History panel, and you'll see that everything after the state I had gone back to disappears.",
            "It's as if you went back to a fork in the road, and took a different path.",
            "Everything on the first road beyond the fork disappears.",
            "And the second thing to keep in mind is that when you close the image, whether or not you save it, your history disappears.",
            "And the next time you open the image, the History panel will be cleared out, and we'll start again with a fresh history.",
            "Now if the History panel isn't your cup of tea, you can rely on the simple commands, in the Edit menu instead.",
            "Undo for single undo's, and Step Backward for multiple undo's.",
            "Either way, you have lots of flexibility to correct any mistakes or try new approaches as you edit an image."

            "Saving is a critical step in Photoshop CC.",
            "So, let's see how to do it safely.",
            "To start, open this image from the tutorial practice files.",
            "Now let's make a change to this file.",
            "Let's move this small inset photo to somewhere else in the image.",
            "To do that, go to the Tools panel and click on the first tool, the Move tool.",
            "And then move into the image, click right on the small bouquet photo and drag it somewhere else in the image.",
            "I'll just put it here.",
            "You can put it anywhere you like.",
            "By the way, if that didn't work for you, it's probably because you're not on the right layer.",
            "We'll learn a lot more about selecting a layer later in the tutorial series.",
            "But for now, you can avoid that problem by just going over to the Layers panel and making sure that you have the small bouquet layer highlighted.",
            "And then try dragging that bouquet again.",
            "Now that we've made a change to the image, let's see what happens if we use the Save command to save the image with that change.",
            "I'll go up to the File menu, and I'll choose Save.",
            "And what happened is that Photoshop CC went right ahead and saved over and replaced the last version of this image.",
            "In this case, the original file that we started with.",
            "And that's something you don't often want to do.",
            "So, let me show you a safer way to save, that doesn't save over the last version.",
            "Let's make another change, again with your Move tool selected, click on that small bouquet photo and move it somewhere else in the image.",
            "I'll put mine down here, but you can put yours anywhere.",
            "Go up to the File menu, and this time don't choose Save, instead choose Save As...",
            "That opens this Save As dialog, where you can avoid saving over the last version of your file by doing something different, like changing the file name, or choosing a different location to which to save the file.",
            "By the way, if you're on Windows, this dialog box may look slightly different.",
            "It does offer the same options that we'll talk about, but they're just arranged slightly differently.",
            "So, what I'm going to do, to avoid saving over the last version of this image, is to give this version a new name.",
            "I'll go to the Save As field here, that's the file name field if you're on Windows.",
            "And I'll click just to the right of the name before the \".psd\" extension, and I'm going to type \"-v2\", for version 2.",
            "Now, if I were to come down and click Save, although I'm not going to do that just yet, I'd end up with 2 files: the last saved version of the file, and this changed version.",
            "So that's a simple way to protect your last saved version, which is sometimes your original of an image.",
            "Before we do click Save, let's take a look at another important thing in this Save As dialog.",
            "That's the Format menu here on a Mac, it's called the Save As type menu on Windows.",
            "It's a good idea to save your files in the native Photoshop format, which gives them a \".psd\" extension while you're working on them.",
            "To do that, choose Photoshop CC from this drop-down menu, and if you have layers in your file, as we do, make sure that the Layers box is checked.",
            "The big advantage of saving as a PSD is that it will preserve any layers or other editable Photoshop CC features, that you may have added to the image.",
            "So that you can come back and work with those again later.",
            "But you can't see a \".psd\" file on the web.",
            "And if you're sharing it with someone who doesn't have Photoshop CC, they might not be able to open a \".psd\" file, a Photoshop CC file.",
            "So, if you want to share an image that you've worked on in Photoshop CC, I suggest you save another copy of it in addition to the \".psd\", and save that copy in the JPEG format.",
            "The JPEG file could be posted online, it will be smaller to send by email and it will keep any photos in an image, looking good.",
            "So, let's go ahead and do that.",
            "I'm going to go to my Format menu, and I'll choose JPEG, and then I'll go down to the bottom right and click Save.",
            "That triggers this small window of JPEG options.",
            "I suggest you just leave these at their defaults and click OK.",
            "Finally, here are a couple bonus tips about saving.",
            "First: save often.",
            "Don't wait until you're done to save the file you're working on.",
            "Second: save early.",
            "This is especially important if you've created a new file from scratch with the new command.",
            "Because until you do save, that file hasn't been permanently saved to your system, and could be lost if your computer crashes."

            "Zooming and panning are ways to navigate around an image that you'll use often as you work on images in Photoshop CC.",
            "To practice working with the zoom and pan controls, open this image from the tutorial practice files, or open a large image of your own.",
            "Zooming means changing the magnification of the image, as you might do if you were looking at the sky through a telescope.",
            "You may want to zoom in for a closer view of part of an image, or you may want to zoom out to see more of an image on your screen.",
            "The most straightforward way to zoom is to select the Zoom tool, toward the bottom of the Tools panel here.",
            "Then go up to the Options bar for the Zoom tool, where you'll find a plus icon for zooming in, and a minus icon for zooming out.",
            "Let's start with the plus icon activated which is the default.",
            "Then to zoom in, move into the image and click.",
            "And each time you click, you'll zoom in a little further.",
            "To zoom back out to see more of the image again, go back to the Options bar, and this time select the minus icon, and then click several times in the image to zoom back out.",
            "If you want to zoom in again, you have to go back to the Options bar, click the plus icon, and click in the image to zoom in again.",
            "Now you may get tired of going up to the Options bar every time you want to switch between zooming in and zooming out.",
            "So, here's a shortcut that will help you.",
            "When the zoom in option is active, as it is now, you can switch to zooming out by holding the Option key on your keyboard if you're on a Mac, or the ALT key on Windows.",
            "Hold down that key and then click in the image.",
            "And that will automatically switch you back to zooming out.",
            "Then release your finger from the Option or ALT key, and you're switched back to zooming in.",
            "And so, you can click in the image to zoom in again.",
            "The Zoom tool has a couple of options in its Options bar, that you can use to move quickly to zoom levels that you use often.",
            "The Fit Screen option, here in the Options bar, comes in handy when you're zoomed in like this and you want to get back to a view of the entire image.",
            "Just click the Fit Screen option, and the entire image fits itself into your document window.",
            "Another useful option is this 100% option. Clicking this,",
            "zooms you into 100% view of the image, which is the best way to view an image when you're checking it for sharpness.",
            "Now, I'm working on a small screen and this image is pretty large, so when I zoom in to 100%, I can't see the whole image on my screen.",
            "Although you may not experience the same thing if you're working on a large monitor.",
            "So, if I want to see a different part of this image at this zoom level, I'm going to need to move the image around in my document window.",
            "That's called panning.",
            "And it's done with another tool, the Hand tool.",
            "So, I'm going to go back to the Tools panel, and I'm going to select the Hand tool there, which is just above the Zoom tool.",
            "Then I'll move into the image, and notice that my cursor is now changed to a hand icon.",
            "I'll click, drag, and move the image in the document window, to a place that I want to see, and then I'll release my mouse.",
            "When I'm done checking the sharpness here and I want to go back to view the entire image on screen, I'll go up to the Options bar for the Hand tool, and there I'll see the same Fit Screen option that we had for the Zoom tool.",
            "So, I can just click Fit Screen in the Hand tool Options bar, and that takes me back to see the entire image in my document window.",
            "Let me show you another way to zoom.",
            "Instead of clicking, you can do continuous zoom by holding your mouse down on the image.",
            "I'll go back and get the Zoom tool in the Tools panel.",
            "And then I'm going to click and hold in the image.",
            "And the image zooms in continuously.",
            "If you zoom in really far like this, you can see the pixels, that are the building blocks of an image in Photoshop CC.",
            "By the way, the size of these pixels can affect the image quality of a print, which is why image resolution is an important topic, especially for printing.",
            "Something we'll talk more about when we cover resizing an image later in this series.",
            "I'm going to go up to the Options bar and click Fit Screen, so I can see the entire image on my screen again.",
            "One more thing, let's say that you're working with another tool, maybe the Brush tool, and you're painting in a small area and you don't want to switch out of the Brush tool over to the Zoom tool just to zoom.",
            "Well, there's a shortcut that you can use instead of the Zoom tool.",
            "And that is to hold the Command key on a Mac, or the Ctrl key on a PC, as you press the plus key on your keyboard.",
            "And every time you do that, that will zoom you in.",
            "If you want to zoom back out, hold the Command key on a Mac or the Ctrl key on a PC, and press the minus key on your keyboard.",
            "And that will zoom you back out.",
            "So, that's an introduction to zooming and panning, that I hope will help you to navigate your images as you're working on them in Photoshop CC.",
            "To finish up with this lesson, you can close this image without saving."

            "Let's take a look at how Photoshop CC is laid out to help you get comfortable with your workspace.",
            "To follow along with this tutorial, you can open any image.",
            "The first interface element to get familiar with, is the Document window, which is right here, in the center of the screen.",
            "This is where you'll work on your images.",
            "Over to the right of the Document window are the panels, that have a variety of image editing controls.",
            "There are more panels than just those you see in this panel column.",
            "Some of the panels are hidden behind others.",
            "For example, here we have a panel group of the Color panel and the Swatches panel.",
            "If I want to see the Swatches panel, I can just click its tab, and that brings it forward so I can use it.",
            "I'll go ahead and select a blue swatch here in the Swatches panel, and that color will be applied when I use other color features, like the Brush tool.",
            "There are some panels that aren't open on the face of Photoshop CC.",
            "To open one of those panels, go up to the Window menu, and choose from this list of alphabetical panels, a panel that doesn't have a checkmark.",
            "For example, I'll choose the Histogram panel.",
            "That opens the Histogram panel.",
            "And after I'm done using it to evaluate the tones in a photograph for example, I can close it by clicking the double pointed arrow here.",
            "Another important interface element is the Tools panel, which is located to the left of the Document window.",
            "It's this long vertical bar here.",
            "If you're not sure what a tool is, you can just hover over its icon.",
            "And in a moment, you'll see the name of the tool in a tooltip.",
            "To select a tool, just click it.",
            "There are more tools than you see on the face of the Tools panel.",
            "You can click and hold any tool, like the Horizontal Type Tool here, that has a little triangle at its bottom right corner.",
            "And you'll see a flyout menu of related tools.",
            "So, if I want to add text not in a horizontal orientation, but rather in a vertical orientation, I can just slide down to the Vertical Type Tool in this flyout menu, and select it from there.",
            "Each tool has a number of controls called options.",
            "And those are found in the next major interface element, the horizontal Options bar, up here at the top of the screen.",
            "The important thing about the Options bar, is that it changes, depending on what tool is selected.",
            "So, because I have the Vertical Type Tool selected, I see options for text, like this Font Size menu here.",
            "But keep your eye on the Options bar as I select another tool.",
            "I'll click on the Brush tool for example.",
            "And now the options have changed, to offer Brush Opacity and Brush Flow and more.",
            "Let's go ahead and apply an option.",
            "One of the things you often want to do when you have a Brush tool selected, is to change the size of the brush tip.",
            "And you can do that using the Brush Picker option, which is the first option over here on the left of this Options bar.",
            "I'll click that option to open the Brush Picker, and then I can move the Size slider in the Brush Picker over to the right to increase the size of the brush tip or to the left to decrease it.",
            "And then I'll click in a blank area to close the Brush Picker.",
            "I'll move into the image and I'll apply some paint.",
            "And by the way, the Brush tool is painting with blue, because you'll remember that's the color I chose in the Swatches panel, earlier in this video.",
            "By the way, if I change my mind about that paint stroke or whatever I just did in Photoshop CC, I can undo it by pressing the common keyboard shortcut for undo, which is Command + Z on a Mac, or Ctrl + Z on a PC.",
            "The last major interface element is the Menu bar, at the very top of the screen.",
            "And here you have multiple menus with lots of controls.",
            "For example, if I want to close this image, I can select Close from the File menu, and you can go ahead and close the image without saving, since we haven't made any permanent changes.",
            "So that was a quick look at the major features of the Photoshop CC interface, that you'll use over and over, as you work in Photoshop CC.",

            "So even if your start screen isn't showing, you can always go up to the File menu at the top of Photoshop CC, and choose New... or Open... from there.",
            "Let's go ahead and choose Open... from the File menu, to open some existing image files into Photoshop CC.",
            "That will launch your Mac Finder or your Windows File Explorer, where you'll navigate through your file system to an image file and select it.",
            "You could select one of the practice files that come with this tutorial, as I'm doing, or you can select an image of your own.",
            "If you want to open more than one image at a time, hold the Command key on a Mac, or the Ctrl key on Windows, and select another image file.",

            "At the top of the document window, there is a tab for each Open_Image.",

            "There may be times when you want to add to your document canvas, so there's more room to add elements like text or images to your design.",
            "You can do that by using the Canvas Size command which we'll look at in this lesson.",
            "If you're following along, you can use this image from the practice files for this tutorial or an image of your own.",
            "To add to the canvas around this image, I'll go up to the Image menu, where there is a Canvas Size... command right below the Image Size... command.",
            "Now, just to keep these 2 straight, the Image Size command..., which we looked at in another video in this tutorial, works differently than the Canvas Size... command.",
            "Unlike Image Size..., Canvas Size... doesn't change the size of your actual photos or other artwork or images in a composition.",
            "It just lets you add space around those items.",
            "So, let's select Canvas Size...",
            "And that opens the Canvas Size dialog.",
            "At the top of this dialog, you can see the Width and Height of this image in Inches.",
            "And down here you can add to the Width of the canvas or add to the Height of the canvas or both.",
            "And those fields are set to Inches by default also.",
            "But when you're preparing an image for online use, rather than for print, it makes more sense to change this unit of measurement to Pixels because that's the way we measure and talk about the size of images on screen, as you learned earlier in this tutorial.",
            "So, I'm going to change either one of these menus from Inches to Pixels.",
            "And the other menu changes too.",
            "If you know the total width in pixels that you want the image to be after expanding the canvas, you could type that number here in the Width field.",
            "But it's often easier to just tell Photoshop CC how many pixels to add to the canvas without worrying about what the total will be.",
            "To do that, come down here and click the Relative checkbox.",
            "That sets the number in the Width and Height fields to 0.",
            "And now, I can type in the number of pixels that I want to add to the canvas.",
            "So, let's say that I want to add 400 pixels to the width of the canvas.",
            "I'll type 400 here.",
            "If I wanted to add to the height of the canvas, I could do that too.",
            "I'm just going to leave that at 0 for now.",
            "And then I'll click OK to apply that.",
            "And out in the Document window, you can see that Photoshop CC added canvas to both the left and the right sides of this photo.",
            "What it did was split the 400 pixels of extra width that I asked it for, into 200 pixels on the right and 200 pixels over here on the left.",
            "Well, what if I wanted to add canvas to just one side of this image.",
            "Let's say over here to the right side.",
            "That's done slightly differently.",
            "So, let's undo what we've done so far, try that instead.",
            "I'll press Command +Z on the Mac, Ctrl + Z on a PC to undo.",
            "And I'll go back to the Image menu and choose Canvas Size... again.",
            "The first thing I'm going to do here is to check that the Width and Height fields are still set to Pixels.",
            "And they're not, they've reverted to the default Inches.",
            "So again, I'll change those menus to Pixels.",
            "And I'll double check that Relative is checked.",
            "As I said, I want the added canvas to appear just on the right side of this image.",
            "To do that, I'll go down to this anchor diagram and I'm going to click on the middle box on the left side of this diagram.",
            "What that does is tell Photoshop CC to pin or anchor the image to the left side of the canvas, and put the extra canvas to its right.",
            "So now I'm going to go up to the Width field, and I'm going to type in the number of pixels that I want to add to the right side of this image.",
            "Let's add 800 pixels.",
            "And click OK.",
            "And that's exactly the effect that I wanted.",
            "You probably noticed that so far, my canvas extensions have all been white.",
            "But you can control the color of your canvas extension, here in the Canvas Size dialog, using the Canvas extension color menu here.",
            "By the way, if you're working on another image, and you're not on a special background layer, as we are in this image, then your Canvas extension color menu will be unavailable and the canvas that you add will be transparent.",
            "It will appear like a gray and white checkerboard in Photoshop CC.",
            "I'm just going to click Cancel.",
            "And, if I want to save this image, I'll go to the File menu and I'll choose Save As..., so I don't save over my original.",

            "If you're following along, let's open this image, that you'll find in the practice files for this tutorial.",
            "And then go up to the Image menu, and choose Image Size...",
            "In the Image Size dialog box, you can see the Dimensions of this image reported in pixels.",
            "When an image is still on your computer, that's how we measure its size, in pixels.",
            "But if we were to print this image, we would measure the size of the print in inches, not pixels.",
            "Down here in the Resolution field, you can see the resolution that's currently set for this image, it's 100.",
            "There's nothing special about a resolution of 100, it's just a round number that I picked when I set up the file for this lesson.",
            "Now, what does Resolution mean here?",
            "Well, if you read across this line from left to right, you may get a sense of it.",
            "This is telling us that resolution is a particular number of Pixels/Inch, in this case 100 Pixels/Inch.",
            "Another way to say that, is that if and when you print this image, 100 pixels out of the total 1800 across and the total 1200 down, will be assigned to every printed inch, horizontally and vertically.",
            "Now if you don't like math problems, you can skip the next part, but if you like to think of this in terms of math, here's a simple example.",
            "So, the math problem is: divide 1800 by 100 and you get 18.",
            "That means that at resolution of 100 pixels per inch, this file will print at 18 inches across.",
            "And it works the same way vertically.",
            "If we divide the total, 1200 pixels of height into groups of 100, that gives you 12 groups or 12 inches.",
            "So, the height of the printed image will be 12 inches.",
            "So, if you understand that basic concept, now you're probably wondering, well what's the best number to put in the Resolution field when you're preparing an image for print?",
            "Unfortunately, there's no one answer because that depends on what printer you're using.",
            "But assuming you're printing at home on a typical inkjet printer, it's fair to say, that a resolution of about 300 pixels per inch will do.",
            "If I were to print the image with only 100 pixels per inch, it might look OK, but if you got really close to it, it wouldn't look its best.",
            "Because my desktop inkjet printer really needs around 300 pixels per inch.",
            "So how do you go about changing the resolution of a printed image to 300 pixels per inch in this dialogue box?",
            "The first step is to make sure that the Resample box is unchecked.",
            "Because if we're just changing the resolution, we probably don't want to change the total number of pixels in the file.",
            "And that's what Resample does.",
            "So, let's say that we want the total number of pixels in the file to remain at 1800 by 1200.",
            "We just want to reallocate them into groups of 300 rather than groups of 100.",
            "So, what I'm going to do is type 300 in the Resolution field.",
            "Spoiler alert: when I do that, the number of inches in the Width and Height fields will change too.",
            "So, let's go ahead and type 300 here.",
            "And sure enough the Width and Height have changed from 18 inches and 12 inches, to 6 inches by 4 inches.",
            "And that's the size at which this image will print with the necessary resolution to make the best print.",
            "I'm done here, so I'm going to click OK.",
            "That closes the Image Size dialog box and takes me back out to the Document window.",

            "I'd like to set the size of this image, so that it's a good fit for posting to a particular website, where I happen to know, that the ideal image size is 900 pixels wide.",
            "Before we resize this image, let's check how big it is to start with.",
            "In most cases, you'll want to start with an image that's bigger than or at least not a lot smaller than the resized image that you need.",
            "That's because, if you enlarge an image a lot, at some point, it can start to look blurry.",
            "I'll go down to the status bar at the bottom of the Document window, and I'll click and hold on the document size information.",
            "In the small window that pops up, we can see that this file is 1800 pixels wide by 1200 pixels high.",
            "Since we want to put it in a spot that's only 900 pixels wide on our website, that means we'll be scaling it down.",
            "To resize this image, I'll go up to the Image menu, and I'll choose Image Size...",
            "That opens the Image Size dialog box.",
            "If you like, you can make this window bigger by going to the bottom right corner and dragging out.",
            "Over on the left, you can see a preview of the image and on the right, are the controls for changing image size.",
            "There's a lot of information here, but you don't have to work through all of it, particularly when you're resizing an image that will be viewed on the screen as opposed to print.",
            "As we are in this example.",
            "So, there's just a couple of things to check here.",
            "First, make sure that this Link icon is on.",
            "This is what it looks like when it's on.",
            "If I click it, this is what it looks like when it's off.",
            "So, we want it on, to make sure that the Width is linked to the Height, so that when we resize the image, the original proportion of width to height is preserved and the image doesn't look squeezed or stretched.",
            "Second, make sure that there's a checkmark in this box, the Resample box.",
            "When this box is checked, you're telling Photoshop CC that it's OK to throw away some pixels when it makes this image smaller.",
            "Or if you were making the image bigger, to add some pixels.",
            "And third, take a look over to the right of the Width and Height fields, where you can see the unit of measurement that's being used to report the dimensions of the image.",
            "By default, this is set to inches.",
            "But when you're sizing an image for use on-screen as we're doing in this example, the correct unit of measurement is not inches, it's pixels.",
            "So, I'm going to click on either of these 2 menus, and change it from Inches to Pixels, and the other menu changes too because the Width and Height are linked.",
            "Now it's time to change the size.",
            "I'll go to the Width field and instead of 1800 I'll type 900.",
            "You can see that the Height field automatically changed, and it changed proportionately.",
            "Now, here's a bonus tip: if you wanted an image to have different proportions, say 900 by 400, rather than 900 by 600 in this case, the best way to achieve that would be to use another tool, the Crop tool, which we're going to cover in another movie.",
            "Before I click OK, you may be wondering why I didn't change the Resolution field.",
            "That's because this Resolution field is only relevant when you're preparing an image for print.",
            "When you're sizing an image for on-screen use, as in this example, the number in this field really doesn't affect the dimensions of the image.",
            "So, you can leave it set to whatever it happens to be.",
            "So, after making those few changes in the Image Size dialog, we can now come down to the OK button and click there to close the Image Size dialog box and take us back to the Document window.",
            "If you like, you can go back to the Status bar and check the size of the resized image.",
            "I'll click and hold on the information there and you can see that we now have a 900 by 600 pixel image instead of the original which was 1800 by 1200.",
            "All that is left to do, is to save the image.",
            "I'll go up to the File menu, and I'm going to choose Save As... rather than Save because I don't want to save over the original 1800 by 1200 pixel version.",
            "So, in the Save As dialog, I'm going to give this version another name.",
            "You can type anything you want here.",
            "I'm going to type \"Resize-web.jpg\" for my web sized version of the file.",
            "I'll leave everything else as it was and I'll click Save.",
            "I'll click OK in the JPEG options window, and now we're done.",

            "The Crop tool is one of Photoshop's CC most useful tools, particularly for those of you who take lots of photographs.",
            "You can use it to improve a composition and to straighten crooked photos.",
            "I've opened this photo from the practice files for this tutorial.",
            "So, I can show you the basics of the Crop tool.",
            "I'll start by selecting the Crop tool here in the Tools panel.",
            "As soon as I do, you can see this border around the whole image.",
            "That's the Crop box.",
            "I'll move my cursor over any of the corners or any of the edges of the Crop box and drag to reshape that box.",
            "So, in this case, I might drag it way in to create a very different composition than the original photograph.",
            "As you create your crop, Photoshop CC shows you a preview with the areas to be cropped away shaded in gray.",
            "That way you can evaluate what it is you're about to eliminate before you finalize the crop.",
            "Now, before I finalize this crop, I want to go up to the Options bar to show you an important option there.",
            "And that is Delete Cropped Pixels.",
            "That option is checked by default.",
            "I usually like to uncheck that.",
            "Because when Delete Cropped Pixels is checked, if you finalize the crop and save the image, you'll permanently delete the cropped away pixels.",
            "But, with this option unchecked, you can bring back the cropped away pixels at any time.",
            "Let's give it a try.",
            "I'm going to finalize this crop by going over to the big Checkmark in the Options bar and clicking there.",
            "Now, there are other ways to finalize a crop, but I like this way because it's very simple.",
            "So now you can see the photo with the crop applied.",
            "Let's say that I'm doing something else with the image and then, I change my mind about the way I'd cropped it.",
            "At any time, I can go back and select the Crop tool and then click on the image again, and all the pixels that I cropped away appear back in view and I can change my crop.",
            "This time I might include some of those cropped away pixels.",
            "By the way, you may have noticed that there's a grid of vertical and horizontal lines on top of my photo as I use the Crop tool.",
            "This overlay presents a classic compositional technique known as the rule of thirds.",
            "The idea of this technique is that if you place the important content in an image at the intersection of any of these horizontal and vertical lines you may improve the composition.",
            "Let's give it a try with this image.",
            "I'm going to place the bouquet right at this intersection by clicking on the image and dragging and placing it here.",
            "And then I might reshape the crop boundary a little more, pulling it in tighter on this bouquet.",
            "And then I'll click the Checkmark.",
            "Again, I'm going to click on the image with my Crop tool to try to fine-tune this crop a little more.",
            "I notice that this image is a little crooked, especially down here at the table.",
            "One of the things you can do with the Crop tool is straighten an image.",
            "There are a couple of ways you can do that.",
            "You either can move your cursor outside of one of the corners and manually try to drag to straighten the image, and this grid appears that helps you do that.",
            "I prefer the automatic method.",
            "So, I'm going to undo, that's Command + Z on the Mac, Ctrl + Z on the PC.",
            "So, the image is crooked again and then I'll go up to the Options bar and I'm going to use the automatic straighten tool.",
            "I'll click on that tool to select it in the Options bar for the Crop tool.",
            "I'll move into the image, and then I'm going to click along the edge of this table, hold my mouse down, and drag a little way further along that edge.",
            "Now you don't have to go all the way along with the edge.",
            "Sometimes just a little bit will do the trick, like this.",
            "And Photoshop CC uses your line as a guide to rotate the image so that the content looks straight.",
            "I'm going to fine-tune this crop a little more, maybe bringing up this edge and maybe moving the bouquet over a bit to put it right in the center.",
            "And then I'm going to go up to the Options bar and click the Checkmark to finalize my crop.",
            "So those are some of the basics of the Crop tool.",
            "I hope you give these techniques a try to work on your own compositions in Photoshop CC."

            "Let's take a look at the Layers panel, where at the bottom of this layer stack, there's a layer labeled Background with an uppercase B and a Lock symbol.",
            "That's how to recognize a special background layer.",
            "The content of this background layer is a large photo in the background of the image, in the document window.",
            "A background layer like this has special properties that are different than a regular layer.",
            "For example, you can't change the stacking order of a background layer in the Layers panel.",
            "Try to move it up in the layers stack by selecting the Background layer and then dragging up.",
            "And you just can't drop it on top of these other layers.",
            "Instead, you get this no way symbol.",
            "And when you remove your finger from the mouse or the trackpad, the Background layer pops back down to the bottom of the layer stack.",
            "Similarly, you can't drag another layer beneath the background layer in the Layers panel.",
            "Try selecting another layer, and then drag beneath the background layer and you get that same no way symbol.",
            "A background layer just has to be at the bottom of the layer stack, and its content has to be at the back of the image, behind the other image elements.",
            "Let's go back to the Layers panel, and select the Background layer again to see something else that you can't do with the background layer.",
            "And that is to move it with the Move tool.",
            "I'll go over and select the Move tool in the Tools panel.",
            "I'll click on that large background photo and I'll try to move, and I just get a message that the Move tool can't move this layer because the layer is locked. I'll click OK to dismiss that.",
            "There are a couple other things you can't do with a background layer either.",
            "For example, you can't vary the opacity of a layer and you can't have transparent pixels on a background layer.",
            "So,",
            "what if you want to do any of that with a special background layer?",
            "In that case, you need to convert the background layer to a regular layer.",
            "And that's as simple as one click.",
            "Just come down to the Background layer and click on the Lock symbol and it goes away, and that layer becomes a regular layer called Layer 0.",
            "And now because it's a regular layer, I could do all the things I just mentioned that you can't do with a background layer.",
            "That's just one example, I can move this layer with the Move tool.",
            "I have the Move tool still selected, I'll move into the image and I'll drag to the right and that does move Layer 0, and it reveals transparency behind it, because this is the bottom most layer in the layer stack.",
            "Now, what if you did want to have a special background layer and you didn't have one in your file.",
            "Well you can make any layer into a special background layer by going up to the Layer menu, and choosing New, Background from Layer.",
            "I actually want to make a new layer in this case and make that the background layer.",
            "So, I'll go down to the bottom of the Layers panel and I'll click the Create New Layer button.",
            "That makes a new Layer 1, which I'll drag to the bottom of the layer stack.",
            "Layer 1 is currently empty.",
            "I'll fill it with white.",
            "To do that, I'm going to go up to the Edit menu, and I'll choose Fill... In the Fill dialog that opens, I'll change the first drop-down menu to White.",
            "And I'll click OK.",
            "And now we have a white layer at the bottom of the layer stack.",
            "To change that into a special background layer, I'll go up to the Layer menu and choose New, Background from Layer.",
            "And now that layer is locked, I can't move it, or do the other things that I mentioned.",
            "And it's providing a stable base for this composition.",

            "So, the first step is to go to the Layers panel, and select the layer above which you want your new layer.",
            "I'm going to select the Background layer.",
            "Next, go to the File menu, and choose Place Embedded...",

            "Before you complete the placement, you'll scale down the photo and place it where you want it in the composition.",
            "To scale this photo down proportionately without distorting it, hold the Shift key as you drag from any of the corners inward.",
            "If you want your added photo to be about the same size as one of the other small photos in this composition, use one of those photos as a guide to help you size this one. I'll remove my finger from the mouse or trackpad, and release the Shift key.",
            "I'll hold the Shift key down and come over to this other corner and drag inward there to get the added photo just about the same size as this other small photo.",
            "Next, you want to position the added photo where you want it in the composition.",
            "To do that, click inside of the border and drag.",

            "When you're happy with the size and the placement of your added photo, complete the placement by going up to the Options bar and clicking the big Checkmark there.",
            "And that's all there is to it.",
            "If later you decide that you want to move the added photo, you can do that by just selecting its layer, getting the Move tool in the Tools panel, and dragging the added photo elsewhere in the composition.",
            "Or let's say you want to change the size of the added photo.",
            "You can do that too.",
            "And to do that, you'll use the Free Transform command that we learned about in an earlier video in this tutorial.",
            "So, let's say I wanted that middle image to be a different size, I would make sure its layer is selected in the Layers panel, I'd go up to the Edit menu, and choose Free Transform, hold the Shift key to constrain proportions and drag from any of the corners to change the size of that photo.",
            "And then click the Checkmark in the Options bar to commit that change.",
            "There's one thing to keep in mind when you use the Place Embedded command.",
            "And that is, that there are some edits you can't do directly on the resulting smart object, that this command creates.",
            "Now, there's lots to learn about smart objects, but for now, let's just talk about what to do if you run into this situation.",
            "Let's say that I wanted to paint on the photo that I added.",
            "I'll make sure I have its layer selected in the Layers panel, and I'll go over to the Tools panel, and I'll select the Brush tool.",
            "When I move into the image and click to paint, I get this message saying that \"This object must be rasterized before proceeding\".",
            "This means that if I click OK, I'll be converting my added photo layer into a regular pixel-based layer.",
            "And that's just fine, so I click OK.",
            "And that's the simple solution that will allow me to paint on my added photo.",

            "Let's take a look at the functions you'll use most often when you're working with layers in the Layers panel.",
            "You can follow along with this image from the practice files for this tutorial or with a layered image of your own.",
            "Over on the right in the Layers panel, the order in which the layers are stacked from top to bottom controls the front to back arrangement of content in the image.",
            "For example, in this image, the tailor layer is above the pattern layer in the Layers panel.",
            "And so, in the image, the tailor photo with the man in the red hat is on top of the pattern photo where those two photos overlap.",
            "Well, what if you wanted the tailor photo here to be behind the pattern photo in the image?",
            "In that case, come over to the Layers panel and select the tailor photo by clicking on it.",
            "Then click, hold and drag the tailor layer beneath the pattern layer.",
            "Now this can be tricky.",
            "You need to wait until you see a double line below the pattern layer and then release your finger from the mouse or the track pad.",
            "And that moves the tailor layer beneath the pattern layer in the Layers panel.",
            "And look what happened over in the image: The photo of the tailor is behind the photo of the pattern.",
            "Another thing you're probably wondering about, is how to create a new layer.",
            "Let's say that I want a new empty layer on which I could add pixels, maybe by painting with a Brush tool.",
            "First, think about where you want to add the layer in the layer stacking order and select the layer just below that.",
            "In this example, I'd like to add a new layer above the pattern layer, because I want to paint on top of this pattern.",
            "So, I'll go to the Layers panel and I'll select the pattern layer.",
            "And then I'll create my new layer by going to the bottom of the Layers panel and clicking this icon with the turned-up page corner.",
            "That creates a new layer above the pattern layer.",
            "Adding a layer this way creates a pixel based layer on which you could do things like add color.",
            "If you use a different tool, like the Type tool or the Shape tool, or if you use the Place Embedded command to add a new photo or another image to a composition - all of this we'll do later in this tutorial series - Photoshop CC will make a new layer for you automatically.",
            "So, don't be surprised if you see extra layers in your Layers panel when you use any of those functions.",
            "When you do make a new layer, it's a good idea to give it a name that's meaningful to you, so it's easier to find later.",
            "To rename any layer, double-click right on the layer name and typewrite over it to enter your own name.",
            "I'm going to type \"paint\".",
            "And then press Enter or Return on the keyboard.",
            "Now let's put this new layer to use by adding some color to it.",
            "I'll go up to the Swatches panel.",
            "If your Swatches panel isn't open, open it from the Window menu at the top of the screen.",
            "In the Swatches panel, I'm going to click on a color.",
            "You can use any color you like.",
            "And then I'll move over to the Tools panel, where I select the Brush tool.",
            "I go up to the Options bar for the Brush tool and I click on the Brush Picker where I have a Size slider that I can drag to the right to change the size of this brush.",
            "And then I move into the image and I'll start to paint and the Brush Picker closes as I paint on the pattern.",
            "Because the paint is on its own layer in the Layers panel you have lots of flexibility to edit that paint swatch without affecting the rest of the image.",
            "As just one example, you could change the opacity of the paint layer.",
            "With the paint layer selected I'll go up to the top of the Layers panel and I'll click the arrow to the right of Opacity.",
            "And then I'll drag the Opacity slider to the left.",
            "Keep your eye on the paint swatch as I do this and you can see that it gets less and less opaque or more transparent.",
            "I'll click off of the Opacity slider in a blank area to close that slider.",
            "That's a simple way to blend the content of 2 layers together.",
            "Finally: What if you decide that you don't want the contents of the new layer at all?",
            "You can delete that layer or any layer by selecting it and then pressing the Delete key on a Mac keyboard or the Backspace key on a Windows keyboard.",
            "And don't worry: You can undo that by pressing Command + Z on the Mac or Ctrl + Z on a Windows keyboard.",
            "And here's a bonus tip: There're even more layer related commands located in the Panel menu, which you can access by clicking this little Menu icon at the top right of the Layers panel.",
            "So, if you ever want to do something else with your layers - like maybe duplicate a layer - take a look in this menu.",
            "So that's how to use some of the most common layer functions: Changing layer stacking order, creating a new pixel based layer, changing layer opacity and deleting a layer."

            "I've closed my other panels, so that we can focus on the Layers panel.",
            "But you can skip that.",
            "By the way: If your Layers panel isn't showing, go up to the Window menu and choose Layers from there.",
            "The Layers panel is where you go to select and work with layers.",
            "In this image there are 4 layers, each with separate content.",
            "If you click the Eye icon to the left of a layer, you can toggle the visibility of that layer off and on.",
            "So, I'm going to turn off the visibility of the tailor layer.",
            "And keep your eye on the image, so you can see what's on that layer.",
            "I'll do the same for the cloth layer and for the pattern layer.",
            "You can see that the bottom layer, the Background layer, is filled with white, because this image started with a new blank image preset with a white background.",
            "Let's turn on all the other layers again by clicking in the empty box just to the left of each layer to add the Eye icon back in.",
            "Now let's take a look at just one layer, the tailor layer.",
            "A quick way to turn off all the layers except the tailor layer, is to hold down the Option key on the Mac, or the ALT key on the PC, and click on the Eye icon to the left of the tailor layer.",
            "In the Document window, you can see that this layer contains just the one small photo surrounded by a gray and white checkerboard pattern.",
            "That pattern represents transparent pixels, which allow us to see down through the corresponding part of this layer to the content of the layers below.",
            "So, let's turn that content back on by going back to the Layers panel, again holding the Option key on the Mac or the ALT key on the PC and clicking on the Eye icon to the left of the tailor layer.",
            "And all the other layers and their Eye icons come back into view.",
            "So again: You might think of layers like a stack of pints of glass, each with its own artwork and in some cases transparent areas that let you see down through to the layers below.",
            "The biggest benefit of having items on separate layers like this, is that you'll be able to edit pieces of an image independently without affecting the rest of the image.",
            "Follow along with this example to see what I mean.",
            "Let's say you wanted to edit or move just the small photo of the cloth being cut.",
            "To do that, you'd have to select the layer that contains that photo.",
            "Go to the Layers panel and click on the cloth layer just to the right of the layer name.",
            "Now that the cloth layer is selected, any editing you do will affect only that layer.",
            "For example, go to the Tools panel and select the Move tool and then click on the cloth photo and drag - and only that photo moves, because only that layer is selected.",
            "And this applies to other kinds of edits too.",
            "For example, if you painted on the image or applied a filter, as you'll do later in this tutorial series, those edits would affect only the selected cloth layer and not the rest of the image.",
            "By the way: There are some editing activities, like moving layers, that you can do to more than one layer at a time.",
            "And to do that, you need to select more than one layer.",
            "Over in the Layers panel, we already have the cloth layer selected.",
            "If you don't, click on that layer.",
            "To select the tailor layer too, hold down the Command key on a Mac or the Ctrl key on a PC, and click on the tailor layer.",
            "With both layers selected, you can click and drag either of those photos and they'll move together.",
            "Now here's a bonus tip: With the Move tool selected, take a look at its Options bar.",
            "And you'll see this option, Auto-Select: Layer is checked.",
            "With that option checked, clicking anywhere in the image will automatically select the top layer at that location that contains content.",
            "For example, watch the Layers panel as I click over here on the pattern photo and you'll see that the pattern layer was automatically selected for you in the Layers panel.",
            "Sometimes that's really useful, but sometimes it can cause you to inadvertently select a layer that you didn't mean to.",
            "To avoid that you can uncheck Auto-Select: Layer in the Move tool Options bar and instead select layers manually by clicking on them in the Layers panel, as we did in this tutorial.",
            "So, to recap: Being able to work with selected pieces of content independently is the biggest benefit of using layers.",
            "There's lots more to learn about layers, so stay tuned for the rest of this tutorial."

            "If you're comfortable applying adjustments directly to an image, you may want to take things a step further, by applying similar adjustments in a more flexible way, as adjustment layers.",
            "You can use this image from the practice files for this tutorial to follow along.",
            "Over in the Layers panel, make sure you have the layer selected above which you want your adjustment layer.",
            "Keeping in mind that an adjustment layer will affect all layers beneath it by default.",
            "I've selected the top layer here, which contains this small photo of a bouquet.",
            "Now let's add an adjustment layer.",
            "One way to do that, is to go to the bottom of the Layers panel and click this icon.",
            "The one that looks like a half-black half-white circle.",
            "The menu that pops up, contains many of the same adjustments that you can apply as a direct adjustment from the Image menu at the top of the screen.",
            "But applying them from here as adjustment layers gives you more editing flexibility and protects your original photo from direct changes.",
            "I'm going to choose the Black & White... adjustment layer.",
            "That did 2 things: It automatically created a new layer in the Layers panel, above the selected layer, and it opened the Properties panel.",
            "The layer that was created is a special kind of layer, called an adjustment layer.",
            "It doesn't have any image content of its own.",
            "Instead it applies its adjustments to content on the layers below it.",
            "So, in this case, the content of all layers below this adjustment layer is now black and white in the image.",
            "In the Properties panel that opened, you'll find the controls for the adjustment layer.",
            "The controls change depending on what kind of adjustment layer is selected at the moment.",
            "For a black and white adjustment, you can use these controls to customize the color to black and white conversion.",
            "Each of these sliders will lighten or darken areas in the black and white, that were a particular color in the color version.",
            "For example, to make everything that was yellow in the color image brighter in the black and white, drag the Yellows slider to the right.",
            "And to make everything that was green in the color image, darker in the black and white, drag the Greens slider to the left.",
            "When you're happy with the way things look in the image, close the Properties panel, by clicking the double pointed arrow at the top right.",
            "The good news about an adjustment layer, is that you can access those controls again any time and make more changes.",
            "To do that, just make sure that the Black & White 1 adjustment layer is selected in the Layers panel, and click the Properties panel icon again.",
            "If you don't see that icon in this Collapse panel, go up to the Window menu at the top of the screen, and select Properties from there.",
            "You could just drag more sliders again or if you're not sure which of the color range sliders corresponds to which part of the black and white image, let Photoshop CC figure that out for you, by activating this Targeting tool and then clicking on something in the image that you want to lighten or darken.",
            "Like this flower.",
            "Drag to the left to darken, or to the right to lighten.",
            "Keep in mind that when you do that, you're changing not only the brightness of the object you clicked on, the flower, you're also changing everything that was the same color in the color version of the image.",
            "To close the Properties panel, click the double pointed arrows.",
            "Now an adjustment layer affects everything beneath it in the Layers panel.",
            "So, you can control what's affected by changing the stacking order of the adjustment layer in the Layers panel.",
            "For example, with the adjustment layer selected, click, hold, and drag it beneath the small bouquet layer.",
            "And now the small bouquet layer isn't affected by the black and white adjustment, and the small bouquet photo remains in color.",
            "When you save an image that has adjustment layers, open the Save As dialog box, make sure that Layers is checked, and double check that you're saving in the Photoshop - or PSD format.",
            "That's important because the Photoshop format retains layers so your adjustment layers will be there for further editing the next time you open the image.",
            "And that isn't true if you save only in the JPEG format.",
            "So that's an introduction to adjustment layers.",
            "The most important points to remember for now are that using adjustment layers will protect your original images from direct changes, and will help you to maximize your editing flexibility."

            "But we don't want her skin to look too saturated.",
            "That's a perfect job for a Vibrance adjustment.",
            "To apply a Vibrance adjustment, I'll go up to the Image menu, choose Adjustments and here, there are 2 kinds of adjustments that would affect color intensity.",
            "There's Vibrance... and there's Hue/Saturation... When skin color is involved, or when you need a subtle enhancement to color intensity, then Vibrance... is the best choice.",
            "We'll cover a Hue/Saturation..., and talk about when it's most useful in another video in this tutorial.",
            "I'll select Vibrance... here, and that opens the Vibrance dialog box.",
            "In this dialogue box, you have 2 choices: Saturation or Vibrance.",
            "You can use them singly or you can use them together.",
            "Let's see what they do.",
            "If I drag the Saturation slider over to the right, you'll see right away that the intensity of all the colors is ramped up.",
            "Not only does the weaver's sweater become a richer, more intense purple, but the intensity of the flesh tones and of the loom increases too.",
            "And it really is too strong an effect in this photo.",

            "Instead, let's try dragging the Vibrance slider to the right.",

            "That's how the image looked without the Vibrance adjustment, and here's how it looks with the Vibrance adjustment.",

            "But let's say, that I just want to affect the saturation of the yellows in this image.",
            "To do that, I'll go to the menu labeled Master, and I'll choose one of the color ranges from that menu.",
            "I'm going to choose Yellows.",
            "If I drag the Saturation slider all the way to the right, you'll see that it's affecting all the yellows throughout the image.",
            "Or if I were to go all the way to the left, you can see that I'm lowering the color intensity of all the yellows, not only the yellow flowers, but also some of the foliage too.",

            "I'd like to lower the color intensity of the yellows just a little.",

            "Now, what if I wanted to change the saturation of the orange flowers in the image?",
            "If I go up to the menu, I don't see orange there.",
            "So rather than just guess at what color range might cover the orange looking flowers, there's a tool that I can use right here, to automatically target whatever the orange is in the flowers, and change that color throughout the image.",
            "I'll activate this tool by clicking on it.",
            "And when there's a dark box around the icon, it's turned on. I'll move into the image and click on the orange in one of these flowers, keep my mouse held down, and as I drag to the left, I'm lowering the color intensity of the oranges, wherever they appear in the image.",
            "If I drag to the right, I'm increasing the intensity.",
            "And when I do that, you can see that there's some of that orange color.",
            "Not only in the flowers, but also in the wall, in the vase, and in the table.",
            "I'm going to drag just to the left of 0, maybe to about right there.",
            "If you look at the Hue/Saturation dialog box, you'll see that dragging in the image with that tool activated has moved the Saturation slider and it's chosen Reds as the color range.",
            "I'm going to click on that tool to deactivate it, and then I'll click OK to accept all these changes.",
            "And finally, I'll go to the File menu, and I'll choose Save As..., and I suggest that you change the name of this image, so that you don't save over your original with this version.",
            "So, the Hue/Saturation adjustment gives you lots of options for control and color in your photos.",
            "And it can be applied as a direct adjustment as we just did, or as an adjustment layer.",

            "When you shoot with a camera or a phone, you don't always get a perfect exposure.",
            "A photo may come out too dark or too light.",
            "Or it may lack contrast and look dull.",
            "Or it may be too contrasty and have really dark darks and bright brights.",
            "The simplest way to correct exposure problems like those is with a Brightness/Contrast adjustment.",
            "Let's try it out on this image from the practice files for this tutorial, or on a slightly dark, slightly dull photograph of your own.",
            "First, take a quick look at the Layers panel and make sure that you have the layer with the photograph selected.",
            "When you are working with photographs, often you'll have only one layer.",
            "Then go up to the Image menu at the top of the screen.",
            "And from there, go to the Adjustments category.",
            "We're going to try the first adjustment: Brightness/Contrast...",
            "That opens this Brightness/Contrast dialog box which I've moved over to the side, so we can see the image.",
            "The fastest way to make a change here, is to click the Auto button.",
            "That would move the Brightness and Contrast sliders here to where Photoshop CC thinks they should be.",
            "But if you want more control, you can move the sliders yourself.",
            "The Brightness slider is sometimes all you need.",
            "It controls the overall lightness or darkness of an image.",
            "For example, if I drag it to the right, notice that the photo is getting brighter.",
            "If I would go to the left, the photo would be darker.",
            "I'm going to take it to the right of where we started which was 0, brightening up the photo quite a bit.",
            "By the way, don't feel that you have to use the same values I'm using, either in this video or anywhere in this tutorial.",
            "The right amount is up to you and your taste.",
            "Sometimes, as I said, increasing or decreasing brightness is all you have to do to improve a dark or light photo.",
            "But there's another slider here too, the Contrast slider.",
            "This slider controls the range of light and dark tones in an image.",
            "If you increase contrast, I'll drag the Contrast slider way over, so you can see what it does.",
            "The dark tones in the image get darker, and the bright tones get brighter.",
            "Too much contrast like this, can make it difficult to see detail in the shadow areas, like in these flowers here or over here, and can cause a loss of detail in bright highlight areas.",
            "Like up here in the background.",
            "So that's what high contrast looks like.",
            "Let's go to the other extreme and pull this slider, all the way to the left.",
            "And now you can see what a low contrast image might look like.",
            "A little bit flat, a little bit dull.",
            "I'm going to put Contrast back where I started, at 0 by typing 0 into the value field for the Contrast slider.",
            "So, I think this image could use a little more pop.",
            "Therefore, I'm going to drag the Contrast slider just slightly to the right.",
            "And that will often do the trick.",
            "One way to help you evaluate whether your changes have really improved the image, is to see it before and after view.",
            "And you can do that by clicking the Check box next to Preview in this dialog.",
            "So, there's how the image started.",
            "And here's how it looks, with the increased brightness and contrast that we applied.",
            "When you're satisfied, click OK.",
            "And that applies your changes directly to the selected layer, in this case to the photograph.",
            "If you don't like them, you still have a chance to undo or step backwards as we learned to do earlier in this series.",
            "But just to make sure you can always get back to the original, I suggest that when you save an image you've adjusted, like this, you choose Save As... rather than Save.",
            "And give the file a different name.",
            "And then click the Save button.",
            "Now a direct Brightness/Contrast adjustment, like the one we used, is not the only way to correct exposure problems.",
            "Later in this tutorial, we'll learn how to apply an adjustment more flexibly, as a readable adjustment layer.",
            "And there are other ways to tackle exposure too.",
            "Like levels and curves adjustments, that you'll explore as you get more experienced with Photoshop CC.",
            "But the Brightness/Contrast adjustment is a relatively simple solution, that can often improve the look of your photos."

            "To make sure the layer with the content you want to select is highlighted there.",
            "Go to the Tools panel and click on the Quick Selection tool.",
            "This tool can detect edges of objects based on color and tone.",
            "So, it will do a lot of the selecting work for you.",
            "Let's say that we want to select the mannequin so that we can apply an adjustment to it.",
            "Click hold and drag across part of the mannequin and Photoshop CC automatically selects - at least part of it.",
            "Stopping where it sees an edge.",
            "Don't worry if you don't get the whole mannequin on the first stroke.",
            "As soon as you make the first stroke with this tool the tool sets itself to the Add To Selection option.",
            "So, you can just continue to click and drag over other areas that you want to add to the selection.",
            "If the tool selects too much like this area of the background hold down the Option key or the ALT key on Windows and click and drag over that area to remove that part from the selection.",
            "As soon as you release your finger from the mouse or the trackpad the Quick Selection tool goes back to the Add To Selection mode.",
            "So, you can drag over any other areas you want to include in the selection.",
            "Like this area up here.",
            "Alternatively, you could go to the Options bar and click on the Plus and Minus options there.",
            "But it really does make more sense to use the shortcut with this tool.",
            "One reason is that you may have to go back and forth a few times.",
            "As in this area here where there's not much contrast between the background and the mannequin.",
            "So, with my finger off the mouse I'll add to the selection by dragging along this edge.",
            "And then, I'll hold the Option or ALT key.",
            "And I'll subtract from the selection I'll release my finger and I'll add to the selection again.",
            "And I might have to subtract one more time.",
            "Fortunately, this tool learns as you work so you may have to give it just a few tries subtracting from and adding to a difficult edge to select it.",
            "Another useful tool in a situation like this is the Lasso tool.",
            "A selection tool that makes free form selections.",
            "It's located over here in the Tools panel.",
            "Go ahead and click on it now.",
            "The Lasso tool often comes in handy to manually clean up selections made with another tool.",
            "And yes, you can use more than one selection tool to complete a selection.",
            "The first thing we need to do is go up to the Options bar for the Lasso tool and switch it from its default to its Add To Selection option.",
            "Otherwise, if we were to click with this tool at its default setting we might lose our entire initial selection.",
            "If that does happen to you just use the Undo or Step Backward commands to try to get your selection back.",
            "So, I'll click on the Add To Selection option and then I'll move into the image.",
            "And here I see a small area that I didn't manage to get with the Quick Selection tool.",
            "I'm going to carefully click and drag along the edge and then around and back to the beginning to include that area in my selection.",
            "You can also subtract from a selection with the Lasso tool.",
            "To do that, go back up to the Options bar and click the Subtract From Selection icon.",
            "Then I'll move into the image and here I want to remove this small area.",
            "So, I'll carefully move along the edge all the way around and back to the beginning.",
            "So, with this selection I'm going to apply an adjustment. I'll go up to the Image menu and I'll choose Adjustments and Brightness/Contrast... and in the Brightness/Contrast dialog box I'll drag the Brightness slider over to the right to brighten just the area that we'd selected - the mannequin.",

            "When you're comfortable making selections you may want to take things a step further.",
            "By viewing and fine-tuning a selection in the special Select and Mask... workspace.",
            "Give it a try with this image from the tutorial practice files.",
            "Start by making an initial selection of this jacket.",
            "You can do that here in Photoshop's CC main interface or in the Select and Mask... workspace that we'll visit in a minute.",
            "We're going to do it here in the main interface using the Quick Selection tool which you already learned how to do, in an earlier video in this tutorial.",
            "So, click on the Quick Selection tool and then move into the image and click and drag over the jacket.",
            "On this side, and then on this side too.",
            "And if your tool selects the area in the middle hold down the Option key. - that's the ALT key on Windows.",
            "And click and drag there, to remove that area from the selection.",
            "I'll release my finger from the mouse and the tool automatically switches back to Add To Selection mode.",
            "And I'll come up to the shoulder and click and drag over this extra bit that I'd missed. to add that into the selection too.",
            "Now go to the Options bar and click Select and Mask... or go up to the Select menu and you can choose Select and Mask... from here.",
            "No matter which selection tool you have selected.",
            "That opens a separate workspace.",
            "The Select and Mask... workspace.",
            "Start here, by going to the right side of the workspace and clicking the View menu icon to open this menu of different ways to view the current selection.",
            "Depending on the image you're using you'll find that different views give you the most accurate information about what could be improved in your initial selection.",
            "For example, let's click on this Overlay (V) view.",
            "This view is showing us everything that's outside the selection with a transparent red overlay.",
            "So, we can more clearly see that the initial selection isn't exactly true to the edge of the jacket.",
            "There are parts of the jacket that had been left out of the selection.",
            "And there's a little bit of the background that's included in the selection - that shouldn't be.",
            "Like this area here on the bottom right.",
            "To try to fix that we'll use one of the tools over here in the Abbreviated Tools panel.",
            "Here you'll find some of the same tools as in the main Photoshop CC interface.",
            "And they work the same way here too.",
            "For example, there's a Quick Selection tool, a Lasso tool, a Hand tool for panning and a Zoom tool for zooming.",
            "Go ahead and select the third tool from the top.",
            "This is a Brush tool that lets you simply paint to add to or subtract from the selection.",
            "Move in to the image and simply paint over an area like this part right here that's covered in red.",
            "And as you see, that area becomes clear as I paint over it.",
            "I'll do the same up here.",
            "And over here.",
            "Now if I want to remove something from the selection like down here.",
            "I'll go up to the Options bar for this Brush tool and click on the Minus symbol.",
            "And then I'll come over here and I'll paint.",
            "Now as you're painting you may want to use the Zoom tool to zoom in for a closer view.",
            "I'm just going to paint like this quickly.",
            "I'll go back up to the Options bar and I'll switch back to the Add To selection and I'll add in a little bit that I missed right over here.",
            "Of course, there are lots of other controls in the Select and Mask... workspace.",
            "As you can see.",
            "And you can explore those as you become more familiar with Photoshop CC.",
            "But this introduction will get you started with basic Select and Mask... features, like the View menu and a couple of the tools over on the left.",
            "Now before you close the Select and Mask... workspace you need to choose how you would like to output your improved selection.",
            "So, go over to the right side and if you need to click the Scroll bar there and scroll down until you see a menu labeled Output Settings.",
            "Click the arrow on that menu.",
            "I'm going to scroll down again and choose from the Output To menu and I'm going to choose to output with the first default option Selection.",
            "And that will tell Photoshop CC to output the improved selection in the view you're used to - the 'marching ants' view.",
            "Then, click OK to close the Select and Mask... workspace and go back to the main interface with the improved selection that appears as 'marching ants'.",
            "As you know, anything you do to the image now will affect only the area inside the selection.",
            "The jacket.",
            "So, let's do something we've done in earlier tutorials in this series.",
            "Add a Brightness/Contrast... adjustment.",
            "I'll go up to the Image menu Adjustments Brightness/Contrast... and in the Brightness/Contrast dialog box I'll drag this Brightness slider over to the right. Brightening the jacket.",
            "And then I'll click OK.",
            "Finally, I'll deselect by pressing Command + D on a Mac or Ctrl + D on Windows.",
            "Or you can go to the Select menu and choose Deselect.",
            "And if you want a copy of this image with this adjustment without saving over the original, use the Save As... command as we've done throughout this tutorial series.",
            "So that's a brief introduction to how to view and fine-tune a selection using just some of the features in the Select and Mask... workspace."

            "So, you can make adjustments to that part, or work on only that area.",
            "Once you've made a selection only the selected area will be impacted by your edits.",
            "Whether those involve making an image adjustment, applying a filter, painting or lots more.",
            "In this video, we'll cover some basics about working with selections.",
            "You can follow along with this image from the practice files for this tutorial.",
            "Let's jump right in and make a selection.",
            "We're not focusing on selection tools in this video.",
            "So, let's just use the first selection tool in the Tools panel.",
            "Which is the Rectangular Marquee tool.",
            "This tool is used to make rectangular and square shaped selections.",
            "Click on that tool and then move into the image and start at the upper left corner of this building and click and drag out a rectangular selection of part of the building and include the parking lot below too.",
            "The animated lines you see represent the edge of the selection.",
            "They're sometimes called 'marching ants'.",
            "If you were to do something to the image now like make an adjustment it would appear only inside the area defined by the 'marching ants'.",
            "Before we do that take a look at the Options bar for this selection tool.",
            "There you'll find an icon for Adding to a selection and one for Subtracting from a selection.",
            "You'll use these often and you'll find them in the Options bar for many of the selection tools.",
            "Let's say we want to Add to our selection to include the entire building.",
            "Click the Add to Selection option in the Options bar and then come into the image and click inside the top right corner of the existing selection and drag to encompass more of the building and the parking lot too.",
            "If you don't get it all you can come in and Add to the little bit that you didn't get the first time.",
            "Now, let's say that you go too far - like this.",
            "How do you subtract from a selection?",
            "For that, go up to the Options bar and click on the next icon the Subtract from selection icon here.",
            "Then come into the image and click and drag around the area that you want to remove from the selection.",
            "I'm also going to subtract a little from the selection down here to remove the parking lot.",
            "So, now that we have the building selected let's make an adjustment and you'll see that your adjustment affects just the area inside the 'marching ants'.",
            "Let's go up to the Image menu and choose Adjustments and we'll use a Brightness/Contrast... adjustment.",
            "Which we covered in more detail in an earlier tutorial in this series.",
            "In the Brightness/Contrast dialog box drag the Brightness slider way over to the left.",
            "To darken the building.",
            "And drag the Contrast slider to the right to increase contrast.",
            "And click OK.",
            "As you can see that change is affecting only the area inside the 'marching ants'.",
            "Let's say you wanted to make a different Brightness/Contrast adjustment to affect everything, except the building.",
            "In that case you wouldn't have to start again creating a new selection.",
            "Instead - you can invert this selection to select everything, except the building.",
            "To do that, go up to the Select Menu and choose Inverse.",
            "With this selection active, let's go to the Image menu and choose Adjustments, Brightness/Contrast.",
            "And this time, let's increase the Brightness.",
            "And click OK.",
            "Finally, when you're finished with a selection it's important to deselect.",
            "So that the next thing you do to the image isn't limited by the selection.",
            "To do that, go to the Select menu and choose Deselect.",
            "Or, you could use the keyboard shortcut Command + D, or Ctrl + D on Windows.",
            "It's one to remember because you'll use it often.",
            "When you save this image go to File, Save As... and save it with a different name.",
            "So, you don't save over the original.",
            "So those are the basics of selections.",
            "But there's lots more to learn about making and working with selections.",
            "So, stay tuned for the rest of the videos in this tutorial."

            "One way to try removing a large object is by filling over it with a special fill command: Content-Aware Fill.",
            "Let's try it on this image, where we can remove this large wooden walkway.",
            "The first step is to make a rough selection around the object you want to remove.",
            "We'll use the Lasso tool, but you could use a different selection tool of your choice, keeping in mind that your selection has to include a little of the background, as you'll see.",
            "I'm going to click on the Lasso tool in the Tools panel and then move into the image and draw a selection outside the walkway.",
            "Now this is important: You have to include a small bit of the surrounding area inside the selection all the way around.",
            "Down at the bottom I'm going to go outside the Document window and all the way around and back to the beginning and then release my finger from the mouse or trackpad to complete the selection.",
            "Now comes the main step: Go up to the Edit menu and choose Fill...",
            "And in the Fill dialog box go to the Contents menu and choose Content-Aware.",
            "Then just click OK.",
            "In just a second the walkway is gone.",
            "Let's deselect by going to the Select menu and choosing Deselect or using the keyboard shortcut Command + D on Mac, CTRL + D on Windows.",
            "What Photoshop CC has done is to automatically take some grass from outside of the walkway, use it to cover up the walkway, and then blend the result in with the surrounding area.",
            "It really is amazing.",
            "Now here's a bonus tip: If you see any blurry areas where the walkway was, you can try using the Clone Stamp Tool to cover that area.",
            "To do that go over to the Tools panel and select the Clone Stamp Tool.",
            "And then go up to its Options bar to the Opacity slider, click there and drag the Opacity slider to the left to lower the strength of the opacity of the Clone Stamp Tool.",
            "And then click in a blank area to close that slider.",
            "Move into the image and find some grass that isn't blurry.",
            "If your brush tip is really small, press the right bracket key on the keyboard, which is near the P key on the keyboard, a couple of times to make the brush tip bigger.",
            "Then sample some of the non-blurry grass by holding down the Option key on the Mac or the ALT key on Windows, so the cursor changes to this target symbol.",
            "Click to sample there and then remove your finger from the Option key or the ALT key.",
            "Now move over the area that's a little bit blurry and click and drag to add some texture back in there.",
            "If you do like the result go up to the File menu, choose Save As... and save your image in the Photoshop format.",
            "You'll be surprised at how big a change you can make to an image by removing large items.",
            "With only a few clicks you have a whole new image to display or to use as a background for a new design."

            "Notice that the brush tip changes to a target icon.",
            "Click there and then release your finger from the Option or ALT key.",

            "When you're removing a spot, you want your brush tip to be just a little bigger than the spot.",

            "Back in the image, to remove that brown spot, I'll just click on it - and poof it's gone.",

            "Now let's try a smaller spot.",
            "Rather than go to the Options bar and try to change the brush size you can change brush size while you're working on an image.",
            "To do that I'll hover over a spot that I want to delete, this tiny blue spot, and then press the left bracket key on the keyboard.",
            "The left bracket key is located just to the right of the P key on most keyboards.",
            "Each time you press and release the left bracket key, the brush tip gets smaller.",

            "Practice those techniques, clicking on spots and dragging over irregular areas, to continue removing the paint from this shirt.",
            "If you get a result you don't like, try again with a different size brush.",
            "And if you need to move to another area, select the hand tool again and drag.",
            "Here you can see how my example looks after just a few minutes working on the shirt with the Spot Healing Brush Tool.",
            "When you're done, select the Zoom tool again in the Tools panel and go up to the Options bar and click the Fit Screen option to see the whole photo on the screen again.",
            "If you're happy with the result, choose File, Save As... and in the Save As dialog box, set the Format to Photoshop or PSD, which is the best format for a working copy of an image, as you learned in an earlier tutorial in this series.",

            "To switch between the foreground and background colors, click the double pointed bent arrow just above the Color boxes.",
            "Now I'll go back to the Eyedropper tool and I'll click on another color in the image.",

            "In this video, we'll go over some basics about Photoshop's CC Brush Style tools.",
            "If you're following along, open this image from the downloadable practice files for this tutorial.",
            "There are a number of tools, other than just the Brush tool that use Brush Tips.",
            "For example, the Clone Stamp tool the Eraser tool the Dodge tool and more.",
            "So even if you don't do illustration in Photoshop CC this video is relevant for you.",
            "One thing those tools have in common, is they have a Brush Picker in their Options bar.",
            "Where you go to choose the Brush Tip and set its Size and Hardness for the tool.",
            "So, let's take a minute to go over what the Brush Pickers offer.",
            "Let's select the Brush tool and then let's go up to the Options bar and click on the icon that looks like a Brush Tip.",
            "That opens this window called the Brush Picker.",
            "In the Brush Picker, you can choose a shape of tool.",
            "And there are many to choose from.",
            "Everything from a leaf shape, to a grass shape, to a round shape.",
            "I'm going to click on one of the Round Shapes here.",
            "And - you can vary the Size and the Hardness of the brush.",
            "Let's see what a Hard Brush looks like.",
            "I'll move into the image and I happen to have a white color swatch selected.",
            "You can use any color you like if you're following along.",
            "I'm going to click and drag and as you can see, this brush stroke has a really hard edge.",
            "Now if I go back to the Brush Picker again and I drag the Hardness slider the other way, towards Soft - and I drag in the image - I get a very different looking effect.",
            "A soft-edged brush stroke.",
            "You can also change the Size of a brush here in the Brush Picker.",
            "In other videos, in this series we introduced the idea that you don't always have to come up to the Brush Picker to change Brush Size.",
            "It's often more efficient to change Brush Size as you're working in the image on the fly.",
            "If I move into the image and I press the left bracket key which is the key, just to the right of the P-key on most keyboards.",
            "Each time I press, my Brush Tip gets smaller, by a set percentage.",
            "And then I'll click and drag.",
            "And you can see that I have a narrow brush stroke.",
            "If I want a larger brush stroke, I'll press the right bracket key.",
            "Which is just to the right of the left bracket key on the keyboard.",
            "And each time I press, I get a larger brush stroke.",
            "So that when I click and drag, I have a very different looking effect.",
            "There are a couple other commonly used Brush options to take a look at.",
            "One - up here in the Options bar - is Opacity.",
            "If I click on the Opacity field and I drag the Opacity slider to the left and then I paint in the image you can see through the paint, to the image below.",
            "Next to the Opacity field in the Options bar, is the Blend Mode field.",
            "These various Blend Modes control how the colors of the paint that the brush applies interact with colors already in the image.",
            "This is similar to Layer Blend modes in the Layers panel.",
            "Which we'll cover later in this tutorial series.",
            "When you're painting with the Brush tool on a photograph like this there's one Blend Mode you'll find particularly useful and that's the Color blend mode down here.",
            "I'm going to select that from the menu.",
            "And then I'll go up and I'll change the Opacity back to 100%.",
            "And I'm going to select another color in the Swatches panel.",
            "But you can use any color you like.",
            "Now when I move into the image and I paint as you can see the brush isn't laying down flat paint.",
            "Instead - it's applying a color tint to the flower that lets the tonal values of the image show through.",
            "And this is very useful for changing the color of objects in photographs.",
            "To finish this off I'm going to go up to the File menu and I'm going to choose Revert, which takes the image all the way back to the way it looked at the beginning of this video.",
            "Let's select the Quick Selection tool in the Tools panel and then move over the flower and click and drag to quickly select it.",
            "Then, go back and get the Brush tool again.",
            "Move into the image and press the right bracket key a few times to make your Brush tip big.",
            "Then click and drag and you don't have to be careful about where you're painting, because the selection limits the area where the paint is laid down.",
            "Finally - press Command + D on the Mac, or Ctrl + D on Windows to deselect.",
            "So that's a quick and easy way to change the color of an image in a photograph using the Brush tool and the Color blend mode.",
            "So that's a look at some basics about Brush Style tools.",
            "Brushes and color, are topics that go hand-in-hand.",
            "Next, we'll take a deeper look at choosing and using colors."

            "Or you can use an image of your own.",
            "The most full-featured way to select a color is the Color Picker.",
            "To open the Color Picker, go down to the Foreground Color box at the bottom of the Tools panel and click there.",
            "And the Color Picker opens giving you choices for the foreground color.",
            "A good place to start in the Color Picker, is with this slider which by default shows you different hues of color.",
            "I'll click and drag this slider to get to the hue I'm interested in.",
            "This light blue hue.",
            "But hue isn't the only property of color.",
            "Saturation and brightness are 2 other properties.",
            "And they're represented here, in this large box.",
            "So, for example, if I want a dark de-saturated blue I'll come down to the dark area and over to the left for the de-saturated shades of blue.",
            "And then I'll click to select a color.",
            "Or, if I want a bright, very saturated shade of blue I'll come up here for bright and over to the right, for saturated.",
            "The color that I choose, appears in this square in the new area.",
            "The bottom of the square represents the last color that was selected.",
            "When I have a color I'm happy with I'll click OK.",
            "And that color appears in the Foreground Color box at the bottom of the Tools panel.",
            "And if I'm working with a tool like the Brush tool, that applies color that's the color that it will use.",
            "The Color Picker isn't the only place to go to choose color.",
            "We've already seen the Eyedropper tool which you can use to select a color by clicking on it in an image and this is very useful when you need to match a color to the colors already in an image.",
            "There are also 2 panels over on the right that you can use to choose color.",
            "The Swatches panel and the Color panel.",
            "If these aren't open, you can open them from the Window menu at the top of the screen.",
            "We've been using the Swatches panel throughout this series of tutorials because they're easy to access.",
            "The Swatches panel contains preset chips of color.",
            "To set a foreground color all you have to do, is click on one of these chips.",
            "And it appears down here, in the Foreground Color box.",
            "The color chips that you've used most recently appear here, at the top of the Swatches panel for easy access.",
            "I'm going to click on the Color tab to see the Color panel.",
            "The Color panel is a lot like the Color Picker.",
            "Over on the right, it has a Color slider that you can use to choose a hue.",
            "And then it has a large field where you can choose a shade of that hue according to its brightness from top to bottom and its saturation, from right to left.",
            "If I select a color here, it appears here in a replica of the Foreground Color box.",
            "And, if I go down to the bottom of the Tools panel, I'll find that same color there.",
            "And then I can use it, with any of my tools like the Brush tool.",
            "So that's an overview of the various places to select colors in Photoshop CC.",
            "You're welcome to use whichever of those methods is most convenient and most comfortable for you.",
            "By the way, if you don't want to save this image you're welcome to close it, without saving by going up to the File menu and choosing Close.",

            "I'll go up to the Font menu and this time I'm going to choose a different font and a smaller font size.",

            "At the end of the first line I'm going to press the Return or the Enter key on the keyboard to add another line of type on the same type layer.",

            "When you want to make an object that has a geometric shape like a rectangle or a circle you could use one of the Selection tools and fill it with color.",
            "But there's another way to make a shape that gives you more flexibility and that's to use one of the Shape tools.",
            "To see how it works open this image from the practice files for this tutorial.",
            "Then in the Tools panel go down to the Shape tools which are located here.",
            "Click the Flyout menu to see the different Shape tools.",
            "I'm going to choose the Rounded Rectangle tool.",
            "Using this tool will automatically create a layer in the Layers panel.",
            "So, go over to the Layers panel and select the layer above which you want your new shape layer.",
            "I'll select the Background layer.",
            "Now come into the image and click and drag to create a shape with rounded corners.",
            "Photoshop CC has made a new layer over in the Layers panel.",
            "This is a special kind of layer a shape layer that contains smooth-edged objects that can be resized and reshaped and still retain their smooth edges.",
            "For example, we could reshape the roundness of the corners of this rounded rectangle shape.",
            "That's done in the Properties panel that popped out when we made the shape.",
            "Come down to this section of the Properties panel and hover over any of the Corner icons.",
            "And then drag to the right to make the corners rounder.",
            "Because there's a highlighted link icon in between these 4 icons all 4 corners change together.",
            "Let's close the Properties panel by clicking the double pointed arrow at the top right of the panel.",
            "And then go to the Layers panel and click off the Rounded Rectangle 1 layer on to a different layer for just a second.",
            "And as you do take a look at the rounded corners and you can see how smooth they are.",
            "Let's click back on the Rounded Rectangle 1 layer again to see that we can also change the size of the entire shape and still retain the smooth edges.",
            "I'll go up to the Edit menu and choose Free Transform.",
            "And this time it says Free Transform Path, because Photoshop CC knows what kind of object we have on this layer.",
            "Hold down the Shift key to constrain proportions and the Option key that's the ALT key on windows to resize the shape from the center out.",
            "And then go to any of the corners and drag outward and you can make the shape bigger.",
            "And while we're still in Free Transform let's change the shape of the shape.",
            "I'll go to the bottom edge of the shape and I'll drag up.",
            "And then let's accept these changes by going up to the Options bar and clicking the Checkmark.",
            "Now if you go back to the Layers panel and click on another layer you can see that the edges of the shape are still smooth.",
            "Let's click on the Rounded Rectangle 1 layer one more time to move the shape into place.",
            "I'll go to the Tools panel and I'll get the Move tool and then I'll click and drag the shape using the pink smart guides that appear to align it to the other elements in the image.",
            "One of my favorite things about shape layers is the way that you can change the color of a shape layer on-the-fly.",
            "Go over to the Layers panel and double-click on the thumbnail on the Rounded Rectangle Layer.",
            "That opens the Color Picker.",
            "As long as the Color Picker is open when you move out into the image your cursor changes to an Eyedropper.",
            "And you can click on any part of the image to sample the color from there and automatically color your shape.",
            "Click OK to close the color picker.",
            "And you can reopen the Color Picker any time the same way and choose a different color for your shape.",
            "In many ways, a shape layer acts just like any other layer.",
            "For example, you can change the opacity of a shape layer.",
            "To do that go to the Opacity slider at the top of the Layers panel and drag to the left to make the shape less opaque or more translucent.",
            "When you're ready to save an image that has shape layers be sure to use the Save As... command and save the working file in a format that retains layers - like the Photoshop or PSD format.",
            "That way your shape layers will be available the next time you open the file so you can make changes to them.",
            "Take some time to experiment with some of the other Shape tools that are located in the same place in the Tools panel.",
            "Like the Ellipse tool which you can use to make ovals and circles.",
            "Coming up we'll explore the Custom Shape tool and discover lots of custom shapes that come with Photoshop CC that you may not know you have."

            "Go to the Layers panel and select the type layer.",
            "Then go over to the Tools Panel and select the Type tool.",
            "You don't have to highlight all the text on the layer.",
            "Now if you want to make a change let's say a change to the font size go up to the Options bar and choose the option that you want.",
            "So, I'm going to type in a different point size here in the Font Size field.",
            "And that affected everything on this type layer.",
            "The same is true if you have multiple lines of type on a layer.",
            "To see that let's select this type layer in the Layers panel.",
            "We still have the Type tool selected in the Tools panel.",
            "So, we'll go up to the Options bar and we'll click on the Font Color field.",
            "In the Color Picker, you can choose another color for this text.",
            "I'll move the Color Picker over so that we can see the text.",
            "One thing I sometimes like to do in the Color Picker is check Only Web Colors.",
            "And that limits the number of choices, which makes it easier to choose a color.",
            "I'm going to choose this color gray.",
            "And you can see that that affected all the text on the selected type layer.",
            "And then I'll click OK.",
            "Now let's say that I've clicked on a regular layer and I'm doing some other work in this image.",
            "And then I decide that I want to change just one of the words on this layer.",
            "I don't have to bother selecting the type layer that contains these words.",
            "All I have to do is select the Type tool in the Tools Panel.",
            "And then come into the image and click and drag over the portion of that text that I want to change.",
            "And that automatically selects the correct type layer in the Layers panel.",
            "Now that I have that text selected, I could change any of the options in the Options bar or I can actually change the words of the text.",
            "So, I'm going to type FINE CLOTHING instead of CUSTOM CLOTHING.",
            "And then I'll go up to the Options bar and click the Checkmark to accept that change.",
            "Down at the bottom of this image we have another kind of text.",
            "If I click on that you can see that a type layer is selected and on this type layer there's a text box.",
            "This kind of text is called paragraph text.",
            "Let me show you quickly how this was made and then I'll show you how to edit it.",
            "I'm going to come up here, and with the Type tool selected I'm going to hold down the Shift key and click to start a new type layer.",
            "And then I'm going to drag.",
            "And as you can see that created a text box.",
            "Now you can just type in this box and the text will wrap when it gets to the edge of the box.",
            "Instead of typing I'm going to go up to the Type menu and choose to paste Lorem Ipsum.",
            "Just so that we have something to see in that box.",
            "Now if I change the shape of the box you can see that the text re-wraps.",
            "I'm going to go up to the Options bar and click the Cancel symbol to delete that in progress type layer.",
            "And now let's go down to the actual paragraph text in this image and click on it and reshape the text box to reflow this text.",
            "Hold down the Option key on a Mac or the ALT key on Windows as you hover over one of the edges of the text box.",
            "And then drag outwards to reflow the text from the center out.",
            "Then release your finger from the mouse or trackpad and release your other finger from the Option or ALT key.",
            "And I've managed to reflow the text from 3 lines to 2 lines while maintaining the position of the text box in the center of the screen.",
            "Now I'll go up to the Options bar and click the Checkmark to accept that change.",
            "When you're done editing type layers you want to be sure to save in a format that retains layers, like the Photoshop format or the PSD format.",
            "So that's an introduction to editing type layers in Photoshop CC.",
            "Try these techniques on some of your own images."

            "Give it a try with this image from the practice files for this tutorial.",

            "Go to the Layers panel and select the Background layer.",
            "Then go up to the Filter menu and before you choose a filter, choose Convert for Smart Filters, and click OK.",
            "That changes the Background layer into a special layer that will support an editable or smart filter.",
            "So, let's go ahead and apply a blur filter as a smart filter.",
            "Go back up to the Filter menu, and go to Blur and choose the Gaussian Blur... filter.",
            "In the Gaussian Blur dialog box that opens just drag the Radius slider to the right to increase the blur or to the left to decrease blur.",
            "With the Preview box checked, you'll see a preview of the blur in the image.",

            "Take a look at the Layers panel and you'll see that the background layer has a sub layer underneath it.",
            "And that's the smart filter.",

            "You can apply any filter the same way.",

            "Layer Blend Modes are a quick way to blend 2 images together.",
            "One of the many situations in which Blend Modes are useful is to add a textured look to an image.",
            "To start, open this photograph from the downloadable practice files for this tutorial or a photo of your own.",
            "The first step is to add another image, an image of a texture.",
            "go to the File menu, and choose Place Embedded...",
            "Navigate to an image of a texture.",
            "Like this one from the practice files for this tutorial.",
            "And click Place.",
            "This is just a photo that I snapped of a wall.",
            "It's a good idea to capture images like this when you happen to see them, so that you have a collection of textures to work with in Photoshop CC.",
            "To finish placing the texture image, I'll go up to the Options bar and click the Checkmark.",
            "Take a look at the Layers panel.",
            "Because we use the Place Embedded method of adding an image, Photoshop CC automatically made a new layer for the textured photo.",
            "Make sure that new Texture2 layer is selected, and then to apply a layer Blend Mode, go to this drop-down menu at the top of the Layers panel.",
            "Here you'll find a list of many Blend Modes to choose from.",
            "Each Blend Mode is a different formula for blending the colors on the selected layer with the colors on any layers below.",
            "The results depend on the images you're using.",
            "So rather than try to predict what will happen if you choose a particular Blend Mode, the easiest thing to do is just try them out on the images you are using.",
            "One way to do that is to just click on a Blend Mode in this menu to apply it.",
            "For example, we could click on the Overlay Blend Mode to see how it looks on this image.",
            "Photoshop CC is just blending the colors and tones in the Texture2 layer with those on the Background layer just below.",
            "Or we could try another one.",
            "Let's try Soft Light, which is similar to Overlay but more subtle.",
            "And you could go through clicking each Blend Mode in the Blend Mode menu, to test it out on your image combo.",
            "But here's a bonus tip: there's a quicker way to try out different Blend Modes and that's to cycle through them using this shortcut.",
            "Go to the Tools panel, and select the Move tool.",
            "Then hold down the Shift key as you press the plus key which is at the top of your keyboard.",
            "And each time you press and release the plus key, the next Blend Mode down in the menu is applied.",
            "And if you look at the Layers panel, you'll see the names on the layer Blend Mode changing as I do this.",
            "And if you want to move the other way up the menu, hold the Shift key and press the minus key on your keyboard.",
            "On this pair of images, I liked the look of the Overlay Blend Mode.",
            "So, I'll go back to the Blend Mode menu, and I'll choose Overlay.",
            "If the result is too strong for your taste, you can lower the opacity of the texture layer, using the Opacity slider, which is just to the right of the Blend Mode menu.",
            "With the Texture2 layer still selected in the Layers panel, I'll drag the Opacity slider to the left, by hovering over its name and dragging.",
            "When you're happy with the blended result, go to the File menu, choose Save As..., and be sure to save your working file in the Photoshop or PSD format.",
            "Adding texture to a photo isn't the only thing the Blend Modes are useful for.",
            "Layer Blend Modes are also a simple way to blend the content of any 2 images together.",
            "To practice that, let's go up to the File menu, choose Open..., and navigate to another photo from the practice files.",
            "This one of some tangled yarn.",
            "I'll click Open, and then I'll add another photo to this one, by going to the File menu, choosing Place Embedded..., navigating to a second photo, like this one from the practice files, and then I'll click Place.",
            "And then I'll go up to the Options bar and click the Checkmark.",
            "Let's apply a layer Blend Mode to the top layer.",
            "With the Move tool still selected in the Tools panel, I'll go up to the layer Blend Mode menu, and I'll try choosing an option from here, or as I already showed you, you can hold down the Shift key and click the plus key on the keyboard, to cycle through different Blend Modes to get a different look with every Blend Mode.",
            "I liked Lighten Blend Mode on this pair of images, so I'll go back to the Blend Mode menu and I'll choose Lighten.",
            "You can get some really interesting blends of content on multiple images this way.",
            "So, practice with some layer Blend Modes on images of your own.",
            "In the next video, you'll learn about another way to blend images together and that's using a layer mask.",
            "So, stay tuned."

            "And we'll learn more about layer masking in the process.",
            "We'll start with this photo from the practice files of an art piece by a wood artist.",
            "Let's replace its background with a more interesting shot from the artist studio.",
            "The first step is to bring in another background image.",
            "To do that go up to the File menu, choose Place Embedded..., and navigate to this image and click Place.",
            "Go to the Options bar and click the Checkmark.",
            "Over in the Layers panel, there's a brand-new layer with the new image.",
            "We need to drag that new layer beneath the original Background layer.",
            "But we can't do that, because the Background layer is a locked layer.",
            "If you just wanted to unlock this layer, you could click this Lock icon.",
            "But if you want to unlock the layer and rename it, all in one step, then select the Background layer by clicking on it, and then right click or hold down the Control key and click if you're on a Mac, and choose Layer from Background.",
            "And in the New Layer dialog box that appears, type a new name for this layer.",
            "I'll call it Pencil and then click OK.",
            "Now select the Replace_Background2 layer and click, hold and drag beneath the Pencil layer.",
            "You can release your finger from the mouse or trackpad when you see a double line under the Pencil layer.",
            "The next thing we're going to do, is make a selection of the background, and at that point you could delete it from the image completely, but that would be a permanent change, and wouldn't leave you very much editing flexibility.",
            "To do it a more flexible way, we're going to use a selection with a layer mask.",
            "To see what I mean, click on the Pencil layer in the Layers panel.",
            "Go over to the Tools panel.",
            "And select the Quick Selection tool.",
            "Now you could select either the foreground object or the background.",
            "So just click and drag over the background to select it.",
            "Before we apply a layer mask, we need to have the item that we want to show, not the item that we want to hide selected.",
            "So, we need to invert this selection.",
            "Go up to the Select menu and choose Inverse.",
            "Now go to the Layers panel, and click the Create New Layer Mask icon at the bottom of that panel.",
            "That was a real time-saver because Photoshop CC not only created a layer mask, it also filled in the area that wasn't selected on that layer mask with black.",
            "And where a layer mask is black, it hides the content on the layer to which it's attached, the Pencil layer.",
            "Where a layer mask is white, it shows the content on that layer.",
            "On this mask, the white is showing the pencil and the black is hiding the pencil.",
            "So, we can see down through to the new background layer below.",
            "If you're happy with that result, you're done.",
            "You've achieved your goal of replacing the background image.",
            "But here's a bonus option: You can try to fine-tune the mask to make it look even better.",
            "To do that, go up to the Select menu and choose Select and Mask...",
            "That opens the image with the mask applied, here in the special selected mask workspace.",
            "Earlier in this tutorial series, we visited this workspace when we were fine-tuning a selection.",
            "Now we're fine-tuning a mask which is very similar.",
            "First, let's click on the View menu and choose the way we'll view the image in this workspace.",
            "I'm going to choose On Layers which will let us see exactly how the pencil will look against the new background layer as we adjust the mask.",
            "I'll click on a blank area to close the View menu, and then I'll go to the Global Refinement section of this dialog box.",
            "Here there are sliders that often work well when you're trying to isolate a hard-edged image, like this pencil.",
            "Keep your eye on this white halo along the edge of the pencil that we want to remove, as I go to the Shift Edge slider, and I move it to the left.",
            "And what I'm doing is contracting the mask so that it's hiding that edge.",
            "You also can try dragging the Smooth slider to the right, to smooth out the edge of that mask and I might try dragging the Contrast slider to the right, to make the edge along the pencil a little more contrasty or crisp.",
            "When you're done with the sliders, scroll down and make sure the Output to menu is set to Layer Mask, and then click OK.",
            "And that modifies the layer mask that we already had applied to the Pencil layer.",
            "One last thing: Notice that there's a Link icon between the layer mask thumbnail and the image thumbnail on the Pencil layer.",
            "That means that if we were to move the Pencil layer, the layer mask would go with it.",
            "Go over to the Tools panel, and get the Move tool, and then click on the pencil and drag it over to the right.",
            "Now all that's left to do is to save the image, and you want to be sure to use the Save As... command, and save in the Photoshop - the PSD format - so that you retain your layers and this layer mask, so that you have the flexibility to come back in in the future and fine-tune your layer mask further if you want to."

            "And then go back to the image and paint with white, to show what's on the Object layer, to reveal the pencil again.",
            "Here's a little rhyme to help you remember that.",
            "When you add paint to a layer mask, black conceals and white reveals.",
            "Now go back to the Tools panel and switch to black paint again.",
            "And continue to paint on the layer mask hiding the wood switching to white paint, if you make any mistakes and paint over the pencil.",
            "To speed this up, I'll just show you how the image will look when you're done hiding the wood.",
            "Now don't worry about getting that edge perfect.",
            "It actually would take a lot of time to do it with a mouse or a trackpad particularly.",
            "The point is to understand how layer masks work.",
            "And in the next video, I'll show you another way to do this to get a sharper edge, that involves selecting an object and filling it with black, rather than painting with black and white.",
            "So now, let's finish this up by positioning and resizing the pencil.",
            "We'll go to the Edit menu and choose Free Transform.",
            "Hold down the Shift key, hover over one of the corners and then click, hold and drag in to make the pencil smaller.",
            "Then move outside of the corner and when your cursor changes to a curved double pointed arrow, click and drag to rotate the pencil.",
            "Then move inside the boundary and drag to position it wherever you want it in the image.",
            "And then go up to the Options bar and click the Checkmark.",
            "Now when you save this image, be sure to use the Save As... command.",
            "And save your working file in the Photoshop, - the PSD format - so that you retain the layers and this layer mask.",
            "Because you did use a layer mask to just hide the wood on the Object layer, rather than permanently erase it with the Eraser tool.",
            "The Object layer remains intact and you could come back any time, and fine-tune the layer mask with black or white paint, or even delete the layer mask by dragging it to the Trash icon down here, at the bottom of the Layers panel.",
            "And that editing flexibility is the real beauty of layer masking."

            "It's a brand new feature in Adobe Photoshop Creative Cloud called Perspective Warp.",
            "Now I have a photograph open.",
            "I didn't take this photo.",
            "It was taken by a company called PhotoSpin.",
            "And don't forget if you want to follow along, you can download the assets for this video.",
            "What I want to do first though is make a copy of it.",
            "I'm going to drag it down- this is one way to do it-make a copy.",
            "That is not necessary, but this way we get to see kind of a before and an after.",
            "Now it will work with just about any image, but your first test is to go up to the word Edit on the pull-down menu and go down, and you better see Perspective Warp.",
            "If you don't, no big deal.",
            "Just go out to the cloud, and download the latest version of Photoshop.",
            "Now what does it do?",
            "What does Perspective Warp do?",
            "It literally allows me to re-enter a three-dimensional world to change the perspective of the image as if, as the photographer, I change my position.",
            "Now we're going to do two things.",
            "One is very easy.",
            "I'm going to straighten the buildings out.",
            "The other part's more fun.",
            "Change the perspective.",
            "Now, we've got the tool selected.",
            "You do this by building grids, perspective grids.",
            "So if I click somewhere, you can see your first grid.",
            "We can get in the middle.",
            "Let's talk about how this works.",
            "Get in the middle.",
            "Move it around as a whole.",
            "Go to a pin, move the pins just like that.",
            "If I go to the side, top, or bottom and drag, I can move it.",
            "But the trick is if you hold down the shift key at the same time and move it, it changes the perspective too.",
            "It can help you out.",
            "The other thing I do like is if you select a pin, you can use your arrow keys to gently nudge it into place or get on it, click it, delete it.",
            "Now we need two.",
            "We're working with a three-dimensional item that's been compressed two dimensionally.",
            "We need two planes on this, and we're going to use this right here as our dividing line.",
            "Click and drag this time.",
            "Save you some time in moving it around.",
            "I'm going to leave it right there.",
            "I'm going to come up here and click this one and move it over.",
            "What I want to do is grab and select that line.",
            "Now down here, I think I'll use my arrow keys.",
            "Do you have to do this?",
            "Not really.",
            "But if you do, if you spend the time to get these lines down right based on perspective of the image, it's going to save you time later on.",
            "So I'm going to come over here and grab this one.",
            "I'm going to drag it down.",
            "Now I can use these lines to match up with these, and that's what I'm doing.",
            "Let's do this one down here too.",
            "So what I'm trying to do here is just match those up.",
            "Let's come down just a little bit more, just about like that.",
            "That doesn't look too bad.",
            "Now we need the other side of our box, if you will.",
            "So if I click and drag, I can make another one of these.",
            "Now here's the fun part.",
            "Grab it right here, and drag it over.",
            "Don't hold the shift key.",
            "Just drag it over until you see a blue line up here.",
            "Let go.",
            "Pin to pin, it will match it.",
            "We can now do the other side.",
            "So what I'm going to do here is bring that over and again, I can use these lines here against those lines there.",
            "And I'm going to try to line that up as best I can, come down to this one obviously and bring that one up just about like that.",
            "Again, don't forget you can use your arrow keys if you want it precise.",
            "That's not too bad.",
            "What I want to do is extend it out.",
            "So hold the shift key before you drag it just like that.",
            "All right.",
            "Now we've got the box built around the buildings or whatever the object is.",
            "Come over here and click Warp.",
            "Now when we move the pins, it will change it.",
            "Now since I took the time to get the angles and the first thing I want to do maybe is straighten it out.",
            "That's going to be much easier.",
            "Click this button right here and watch what happens.",
            "Well it begins to straighten it out, but the pins are still independent.",
            "In other words, I can come over to this one and still move it if I wanted to.",
            "if I don't like what it did.",
            "I find most of the time that if I spend the time to get the perspective, it does help things out.",
            "Now you have another one that does your horizontals if you want to do that.",
            "We don't.",
            "This one does both.",
            "This one says, \"you know what?",
            "I so messed this up.",
            "I wish I could start all over again.\"",
            "And if you click it, it will take you right back to where you were.",
            "You say, \"I want to redesign the whole thing,\" you can click here.",
            "Go right back to Layout.",
            "Let's go back here, and let's click that button again because that did work.",
            "Now that's easy.",
            "In fact you might not even need Perspective Warp to straighten a building.",
            "What I love about it is changing the perspective.",
            "Now if I come down to this point right here and move it, these are still independent, and here's the trick.",
            "Come over to this line, hold the shift key down until it turns yellow, and then click on it.",
            "Now that does two things.",
            "If it wasn't perfectly vertical, it is now, but the other part is in Perspective, watch this.",
            "If I come down here and move this point left or right, it locks the top one in and allows me to literally change the perspective where the photograph was taken.",
            "And if you look closely, it's not just stretching the stuff out.",
            "it's working with complex algorithms to decide what it would have looked like if the photographer had changed positions.",
            "That's why I like this thing so much.",
            "It gives you total control over what you're doing.",
            "Now you can even change it by foreshortening it, whatever you want to do to change what you think this image will be and understand we're not talking about a formula where it's got to be 27 degrees because of this, that, or the other.",
            "We're talking about you.",
            "You are the photographer.",
            "You are the designer.",
            "What looks good to you?",
            "Now let's say you like that.",
            "You can set it by clicking right here or you can say, \"I wish I'd never done anything,\" and click here to get out of it.",
            "Well, there you go.",
            "If I turn it on and off, you can see the before and the after.",
            "Perspective Warp is an amazing tool, brand new to Photoshop CC, literally allowing you to get back into the third dimension and change the position of where the photograph was taken.",
            "Well, that's about it.",

            "Now this is different than say, for example, trying to align in Adobe Illustrator.",
            "Adobe Illustrator is an object oriented, vector driven program.",
            "Every piece of the image that you're putting together in Illustrator is a separate object.",
            "You could have in Illustrator, all five of these circles in one layer and you could still align them because they are separate.",
            "In Photoshop, it's about the layer, isn't it?",
            "So if I come over here with layer five selected, I do have my Move tool selected up here.",

            "You can see up here we do have alignment options but they are grayed out right now because we only have one layer selected.",
            "In order to align, you have to have the objects in separate layers.",
            "Don't forget all of the layers themselves are transparent expect for the objects that are in them.",
            "Let's go ahead and turn that back on.",
            "Actually, let me show you a shortcut here.",
            "Sometimes, when I'm working in Photoshop, I want to concentrate on one layer and I want to turn off everything else.",
            "So I come over here and I say, start turning layers off by clicking on the little show/hide icon one at a time, which is kind of boring but it does work, doesn't it?",
            "Well, if you got a couple of hundred layers, that would be no fun at all.",
            "There's another way, you can actually start say with this one and drag down to turn them off, that's faster.",
            "I can drag again to turn them back on again.",
            "However, what if the one you want to look at is say ball three. You'd have to drag down here stop and then drag up here.",
            "Now that would still be better than clicking on them one at a time.",
            "But my goal is to turn off everything but that one layer.",
            "Do this, come over to the layer that you want to show.",
            "Come over to the show/hide icon, hold down the Alt key if your are on Windows, or the Option key if you are on Mac saying key different name and Alt or Option, click it.",
            "It will turn off everything but that one.",
            "If you do that again, Alt/Option + Click, everything will come back again.",
            "Now let's get back to our goal of alignment.",
            "I want to align these circles.",
            "Let me do this for yourself.",
            "Let me move one of them or actually move a couple of them.",
            "If I come over here, we know that if I click, I'm gonna move the one that's selected over here. If I want to move one, one way would be to come over here and click Bar 1 and move it.",
            "But to me, that just takes a lot of time.",
            "There's a couple to tricks for you.",
            "Number one, if I am gonna move ball 5 and ball 5 isn't selected over here.",
            "If I come over, you gotta be on the paint.",
            "There's no paint except for the circle.",
            "Hold on the Ctrl key in Windows, the Command key on a Mac and Ctrl/Command + Click.",
            "So what we did, it selected it.",
            "So I can come here now and move it round, I can do the same thing here Ctrl or Command + Click and then move this one.",
            "That's a quick way to do it.",
            "There is another way though.",
            "If you come up here to your options on the Move tool, one of those is Auto Select.",
            "Some people ask me this question.",
            "They say why is it every time I click on something, it selects the layer and I don't want that to happen.",
            "Or how do I get it to work automatically?",
            "Well, if we go Auto Select and I change this option from Group to Layer.",
            "If I click on one, it automatically selects it.",
            "And I'm not a big fan of that one, because sometimes, I'm just so used to Photoshop being this layer based program that I move something without actually selecting it and I wind up moving the wrong thing, 'cause I got Auto Select on.",
            "But if you want it on, it's on.",
            "I prefer the shortcut and that's the Ctrl key and clicking on the object to move it.",
            "Okay, so we got our objects kinda distributed here.",
            "Let's select all the layers.",
            "I'm gonna come over here and click and I'm gonna come up to this one.",
            "And I'm gonna click that's a Shift +",
            "Click on all of those, select them all.",
            "They do not have to be in order.",
            "Okay, they do not have to be contiguous.",
            "You can select whatever ones you want to align.",
            "Up here, we knock at this lid up.",
            "Now if you come over here, we have controls for aligning vertical and horizontally.",
            "If I click say for example this one right here in the middle, it will align all of those horizontally, let's go and press Undo.",
            "I want to go other way with this, so I'm gonna go here.",
            "But notice we have a left, a center, and a right.",
            "And you might ask yourself the question, left, center, and right of what?",
            "Well, that's why I moved one way over here and five way over here.",
            "If I say align to left, the computer will look for the left most layer.",
            "And when I click, it will align to that left most layer.",
            "I keep align, we say left most object but technically, that's not an object, that's a layer that's got paint in it.",
            "If I say right, we're gonna go to the five.",
            "Or if say center, it will look at the one and the five, find the center between the two and center that.",
            "That's kind of what I want to do.",
            "Now once I've got that, I want some distribution, which is what we have over here.",
            "If I click this button right here, I can distribute.",
            "But it's distributing based on the highest one here the number five and the lowest one here and put all these in based in these.",
            "These did not move, these did.",
            "You have all the alignment features that you need but it's important to remember, you have to have them in separate layers.",
            "Now let's go to our Alignment Tool.",
            "This one is really cool.",
            "It's photograph of a bar, I did not have a lens big enough the entire thing, so I took four photographs and you can see where they overlap. You know, like here to here, to here, to here.",
            "This is kinda fun, select all four layers.",
            "Already got them all four selected.",
            "Lot of people don't know this one, you got a button right here, that's an align or panorama button, click it.",
            "Now in this case, for auto align layers, just use Auto right here.",
            "Watch what happens when I click OK.",
            "Ain't it cool?",
            "It put the photographs together, it looked at them kind of like looking through them like slides and said okay, this one aligns up with this one, with this one, with this one and put them all together into one.",
            "Now we have other ways to do that, but that's built in right now to the interface, all you're gonna do is select multiple layers and click the button. Aligning in Photoshop is fundamentally different than it is say an object oriented application like Illustrator, but it is possible if you remember alignment is achieved by using separate layers."

            ">> Removing distracting elements is easier than ever with the 2014 release of Photoshop CC.",
            "Not only has the Content Aware technology improved in terms of quality, but the speed has also been improved significantly.",
            "Let's go ahead take a look at a few examples.",
            "Now in this image of the cactus, I'm going to select the Lasso Tool and I simply want to get rid of this cactus here in the background.",
            "The easiest way to do this would be to select Edit and then Fill.",
            "I'll use Content Aware, but when I click OK, you'll notice there's a little bit of a seam here where the colors aren't blended very well.",
            "And that's because, in the past, the Content Aware technology really focused on the texture in the image.",
            "So let's undo that Command + Z or Ctrl + Z. And this time when I select Edit, Fill, I'm going to use the new Color Adaptation option.",
            "This time when I click OK, you can see that Photoshop does a much better job in blending those colors.",
            "Now let's go ahead and try to remove the other two cacti here that are blurred.",
            "So I'm going to go ahead and just zoom in a bit, and you can see that we're going to have a problem probably right in this area.",
            "So what I'll do is I'll just select this area here because I know that I want this flower to be preserved, right.",
            "So I will just drag a little selection around it.",
            "And then I'll hold down the Shift key and I probably want to drag around this area right here, and I'll also want to preserve this area here.",
            "Now what I can do is I can just jump those up to their own layer using Command + J so that now we've got just that area on its own layer.",
            "I want to make sure that I go back, I drop down to the background layer, then I'll zoom back out and then all use my Lasso Tool and I'll make kind of a general more broad selection around this area here that I want to patch and then switch over to the Patch Tool.",
            "Now I need to make sure that the Patch Tool is set to Content Aware.",
            "And let's take a look at the Adaptation Options.",
            "It used to be that we only had one option here.",
            "But now I can change the structure, which is going to help blend the edges.",
            "Let's go ahead and make that just one for now and I'll leave the color set to zero as well.",
            "The great thing about these settings is that I can always come back to them even after I use the Patch Tool in order to select a different area of the image.",
            "So you can see that it's done a fairly good job.",
            "It just has a little bit of a problem right down here.",
            "But let's try changing some of these options.",
            "So if I change the Structure up to 3, for example, we can watch as it goes ahead and it recalculates that area.",
            "And that's looking much better.",
            "Now I also am looking at the color area here, and it just looks a little bit blotchy, so I'm gonna move the Color up to 5.",
            "Now the Structure has a range from 1 to 5.",
            "But the Color actually has a range from 0 to 10.",
            "So this is looking much better, it's not as blotchy, but let's see what happens if we actually move it up to 10.",
            "I think now we can see that that background area is really blending in a lot better, so I'll go ahead and deselect.",
            "So you can see how just copying that little area up onto its own layer helps me to use these Content Aware tools around edges of areas that are really busy.",
            "Okay, let's move to this other image right here.",
            "Now not only do I want to reposition this bird, but I actually have two layers in this document and I want to take this bird and move it over into this background area where you can see there's quite a difference between the blues.",
            "So let's switch to the Content Aware Move Tool and I'll make a rough selection here around the first egret and then I'll reposition that bird right down to here.",
            "Let's go ahead and zoom in a little bit and pan over and take a look at what we have.",
            "I'm gonna use Command + H or Ctrl + H in order to hide those edges.",
            "And let's look at the different options.",
            "If I move the Structure up to 5, you can see that the bird is actually rendered a little bit better.",
            "But with the Color set down to 0, you can see this mismatch between the background of the bird from the position in the sky where it was to this area here.",
            "So let's move the Color also to maybe 5.",
            "And it does a much better job blending.",
            "Now let's zoom out again.",
            "This time, I'm going to select the bird over on the right-hand side and I want to scoot it over.",
            "So we again, I'll use the Move Tool, I'll drag it over and position it the way I want it.",
            "And then we can see how good of a job it does at blending.",
            "So it's done a really nice job.",
            "Let's go ahead and zoom in again.",
            "And one of the reasons it did such a nice job, as you can see here, that my Color blending is set up to 5.",
            "Again, I'll hide the edges here so we can make sure that we see that seam using Command + H or Ctrl + H.",
            "And if the blending wasn't enough, we could go ahead and move this to 10.",
            "That's just going to help the seams a little bit and make that bird look like it was in the original image.",
            "So as you can see, refining images is easier than ever using the Content Aware Fill, the Patch Tool, and the Content Aware Move Tool in Photoshop CC."

            "As a new Photoshop user, you're going to find that the layers panel is an incredibly powerful tool.",
            "The layers panel gives you the ability to isolate individual pieces of content away from the rest of the composition giving you the ability to work on individual elements within the overall document.",
            "Now, this can be used for something as literal as some type in this case, or something as subtle as a small brush stroke to add a highlight or shadow to an image.",
            "They also keep you organized.",
            "You want to keep all of your content separated if possible, because that's going to afford you the most flexibility when working inside of Photoshop.",
            "For example, if you wanted to change the appearance of this rectangle, because it's on its own layer, it's incredibly easy.",
            "If it was mashed down here with the background layer, it becomes far more challenging at that point.",
            "But if we want to change let's say the size of the rectangle, all you have to do is select that layer, and then choose a tool.",
            "In this case, I'll use the free transform tool which is Command + T on the Mac, Control + T in Windows.",
            "And then you can make your modifications.",
            "So what we'll do is just make this a little bit smaller, and once I'm happy, I'll press return or enter.",
            "So by having this on its own individual layer, it was easy and very quick to make a modification to that piece of content.",
            "You have the ability to turn the visibility of layers on and off.",
            "For example, maybe you want to look at this image without the rectangle to see what it would look like.",
            "All I have to do is turn off the visibility by clicking this little eye icon.",
            "You'll notice that that content is no longer visible.",
            "Again, this gives you additional flexibility.",
            "You can now save a version of this document without the rectangle, but you still have the rectangle information within the native Photoshop document.",
            "So if you ever needed to turn it back on, you can do that.",
            "You can easily create new layers by coming down here towards the bottom of the layers panel and clicking the new layer button.",
            "With this new layer, you could add any content or paint any pixels that you would need to to improve this composition.",
            "If you decide you don't want the layer, simply remove it by clicking the trashcan.",
            "I'll go ahead and confirm this.",
            "And you also have options for individual layers in terms of fill and opacity, again giving you further control over how this layer interacts with all the other layers within the document.",
            "With this rectangle layer selected, maybe I want to drop the opacity down a little bit.",
            "By doing that, I introduce pixels in the background into the foreground of this layer.",
            "There's also blending mode options, so we could come over and choose the type layer in this case.",
            "Right now the blend mode is set to normal, but you can see there's all sorts of different blend modes.",
            "Honestly, you could spend an entire course on blend modes, but right now if you just experiment with them, you'll begin to see what they do and what they accomplish.",
            "Basically, you're controlling how the foreground pixels interact with the background pixels.",
            "Adobe's built in several tools to stay organized within your layers panel, you can create things like layer groups by clicking this little folder icon, and you can also filter your layers.",
            "It's not uncommon to have hundreds of layers within Photoshop document.",
            "What if you're looking for just type layers?",
            "Well, there's filter buttons up here towards the top.",
            "If you click this button, you'll notice I'm only displaying layers that are type layers.",
            "And you can turn off the filter by clicking that same button.",
            "And you can add as many of these as necessary.",
            "So it's not just one or the other, you can select the layers that you want to view.",
            "Finally, you can also control the stacking order of these layers.",
            "The stacking order ultimately dictates in which order these elements will appear.",
            "Right now, the winter layer is above the rectangle layer.",
            "I'll go ahead and set the blend mode back to normal.",
            "When I do that, if I decide I want the winter layer underneath the rectangle layer, I can simply click and drag it underneath the rectangle layer.",
            "You'll see this highlight which is an indicator as to where you're about to place this layer.",
            "When you let go of the mouse, you can now see that the winter layer is beneath the rectangle layer.",
            "One final note, you don't have that ability with the background layer.",
            "The background layer is locked.",
            "So if I want to put the background layer above all other layers, you'll notice Photoshop doesn't allow me to do that.",
            "However, with the latest release of Photoshop CC, if you want to be able to quickly convert this background layer into a traditional layer, then giving you the ability to change the stacking order, all you have to do is click this little padlock icon, and you'll notice it immediately changes it into a traditional layer.",
            "The layers panel is an incredibly powerful tool, and as you work more and more with Photoshop, you'll find that it's even more powerful than what I was able to show you within this one video."

            "It's my studio in the middle of a project.",
            "What I would like to do is reduce the clutter, reduce the chaos.",
            "Let me move Layers over here again, I would say that is not really necessary, but it makes life easier.",
            "I have an Andy's Funny Face character.",

            "Nothing wrong with that.",
            "It doesn't really hurt a thing, gives me total control.",
            "But I would like to reduce the clutter in my Layers panel by creating something called a Group.",
            "So let's do this a couple of ways.",
            "Number one, we can come down here and click this button right there.",
            "That's a \"Group\" button.",
            "Go and click it.",
            "It will give you a group called: Group 1.",
            "Now, there is nothing in it yet, it's just there.",
            "To get these elements in here is actually pretty easy.",
            "Select this one and \"Shift\" click down here - assuming you want them all.",
            "Now actually maybe you don't.",
            "Let me show you something else here.",
            "If you click on this one and hold down the \"Command\" key on a Macintosh or the \"Control\" key in Windows you can select, well, every other one if you want to.",
            "If you want to select them all - \"Shift\" click.",
            "Now I'll just drag them up to Group 1 Until you see a little box kind of come around Group 1 and let go.",
            "They should indent if it worked.",
            "And then we can close it off.",
            "I'm a big namer of stuff.",
            "So if we get into Group 1 and select it and type in: \"Face elements\" or something like that I suppose that would be good.",
            "There is a lot of advantage if you will, to doing what we just did.",
            "Number one: all the elements are in one area, it reduces the chaos or clutter inside your Layers panel.",
            "If we have the \"Move\" tool selected, which we do, we can move all of them at the same time.",
            "We can use our Locking mechanisms all at the same time, we can use our Opacity all at the same time, and we can Show/Hide all at the same time.",
            "If at any time we want to work on these individually, we can open it up and there you go.",
            "Now let's say, over the course of time that you decide, that you don't want to have these inside of a group.",
            "You could actually drag them out.",
            "Let me show you an easy way to do this.",
            "Select the group \"Face elements\".",
            "Now I actually go down and click this button, which is for deleting.",
            "It's going to ask you: Do you want to delete the Group and the Contents or just the Group? - Quickest way to do it.",
            "Click \"Group Only\" and they come right back out for you and now they are individual.",
            "Another way to make a group, that's actually a little bit easier, is let's go ahead and select them all again.",
            "This time go into your options for \"Layers\" - this button right here and select \"New Group from Layers\".",
            "The cool thing is, it takes you right here and allows you to give it a name.",
            "Click \"OK\".",
            "You did it again.",
            "Let's talk about one more way to do this.",
            "Using searching.",
            "Let's say we have a complicated document that has a lot of stuff in it.",
            "We have a lot of type or text layers.",
            "That's a unique type of layer in the Layers panel, which got a bunch of them you've got a couple of hundred layers and these are scattered all over the place.",
            "And you want all of your type layers in one group.",
            "So we go to the Search facility here and click \"Kind\".",

            ">> The crop tool inside of Photoshop gives you the ability to remove unwanted pixels and as a photographer, you get a second chance to recompose your image.",
            "The crop tool's located here inside the Tools panel.",
            "C is the keyboard shortcut.",
            "When you first select the crop tool, you'll notice you'll see a bounding box around your image.",
            "All you have to do is resize this bounding box, and as you resize it, the pixels that are going to be removed appear grayed out, and then inside the center here where it's nice and bright you get an idea as to what the new image will look like after the crop.",
            "To accept the crop, all you have to do is click this checkmark.",
            "Now there's an option here in the Options bar called Delete Cropped Pixels.",
            "And if you select it and accept the crop, those pixels are removed, never to come back.",
            "That's not really the best way to work unless you have a really specific reason.",
            "My preference is to leave that deselected.",
            "I'm going to go ahead and undo the crop, Command Z on the Mac, Control Z on Windows.",
            "I'm going to turn this off.",
            "By turning it off, if I come over and click and drag out a new crop box and accept the crop- this time I'll double click here within the crop box- I can go ahead and perform any other operation inside of Photoshop.",
            "I can add layers, adjustments, filters.",
            "You name it.",
            "But if you come back to this layer and you choose the crop tool and you drag out a new crop box, you'll notice all the previous removed pixels are now available giving you the ability to reuse some of those pixels that you cropped out initially.",
            "So you still have all of the information of the original image.",
            "And notice I'm just moving the image around now.",
            "So I can position the image relative to the crop box.",
            "So there's a lot of different ways that you can work with this crop tool.",
            "Again, once you're happy, you can come over and click the checkmark, and the crop is performed.",
            "You'll notice when you're working with the crop box, you have some overlays.",
            "There's menu here of different overlays.",
            "So if you want to work with the golden ratio, you can do that, and you'll notice that the overlay is updated.",
            "Some people don't like seeing the overlay all the time.",
            "A good option is to come over and choose Auto Show Overlay.",
            "That way as you look at the newly-cropped area, you don't have any distractions, giving you an accurate representation of what the new image will look like.",
            "But as you resize the crop box, you'll notice that that overlay returns.",
            "So you're getting the benefit of having the overlay without the distraction as you look at the new image.",
            "There's quite a bit you can do with the crop tool, and this just scratches the surface, but now you have a good understanding as to how the crop tool works.",
            "And you'll find as you work inside of Photoshop it's a tool that you're probably going to use fairly often."

            "So for example, I could select Quick Select.",
            "But you'll notice that when I drag the Quick Select cursor around underneath the cactus, it actually selects too much, and it ends up selecting the entire document because there aren't very many tonal or color values between the green and the blue.",
            "So instead, this image would be perfect for using the Select menu and then Focus Area.",
            "Photoshop will automatically analyze the image based on what it thinks is in focus and what's out of focus and then return that to me as a mask.",
            "Now we can change the parameters manually here in order to control what we tell Photoshop is in focus or not in focus, but the best results I find are with the auto button turned on.",
            "Then if I want to refine it, I can either use the Add To or Subtract",

            "I can also hold down the Option key to toggle back and forth between the brushes if I want to include an area that shouldn't have been removed.",
            "Now depending on what kind of selection you're after, you can either get a binary- a very hard edged selection if you turn off the Soft Edge option, or we can enable that.",

            "An adjustment inside of Photoshop allows you to apply color and tonal transformations to an image.",
            "There's a couple different ways that you can apply adjustments inside of Photoshop.",
            "The first option is to come up to the Image menu, and under the Image menu, you can choose Adjustments.",
            "And you'll notice here we have several different types of adjustments that we can apply.",
            "However, the best bet honestly is to come over to the adjustments panel.",
            "If you don't see the adjustments panel, all you have to do is come up to the Window menu and under the Window menu, you can choose adjustments.",
            "So the Adjustments panel will allow you to create an adjustment, but all that adjustment information is stored on a layer.",
            "By storing in on a layer, you preserve all the original pixel information of the image.",
            "Additionally, you always have the ability to come back and make modifications to the adjustment or turn off the adjustment completely.",
            "So for this example, what we're going to do is just click this button right here which is the black and white adjustment.",
            "What's nice about these little icons, if they don't make sense to you, you'll notice a label appears in the top-left corner of the panel.",
            "In this case, we do want to apply the black and white adjustment, so when you click it, it's applied through a layer, and you'll notice that the properties panel opens.",
            "This properties panel gives you the ability to make modifications to the adjustment so you get the exact look that you're aiming for.",
            "For example, maybe you want a higher contrast black and white image.",
            "This building right here is red, so if we want this red building to appear darker, all we have to do is drag the red slider to the left.",
            "And you'll notice all the red values within the image become darker.",
            "Because the adjustment layer is applied through a mask, you have the ability to control where this adjustment is actually applied to the layer underneath it.",
            "We know that white will show the adjustment in this case.",
            "If we paint with black, it will begin to hide the adjustment.",
            "So let's go ahead and take a look at how we can bring some of the color back within this image.",
            "What I want you to do is come over and choose the rectangular marquee selection tool and simply drag a rectangle around this building.",
            "When you do that, you want to fill it with black.",
            "You want to make sure that black is the background color.",
            "If that's the case, you can simply press the delete or backspace key on your keyboard, and you'll notice the color in this building is brought back into focus.",
            "I'm going to go ahead and deselect this.",
            "Now there are some problems.",
            "I've reintroduced color with this tree and some of the leaves here, but that's not a problem.",
            "All you have to do is come over and choose the brush tool, and with the brush tool, you want to paint with white.",
            "In this case, I have a fairly large brush size, and in the interest of time, I'm going to create some pretty broad brush strokes to get rid of the color within this tree.",
            "In a real world situation, you'd probably zoom in to this and be a little bit more careful, but for right now, just to give you an idea as to what you can accomplish, I'm just going to paint over this tree.",
            "And you'll notice I'm de-saturating the color values.",
            "And I can do the same over here.",
            "Remember you can control the size of your brush by using the left bracket and right bracket keys on your keyboard.",
            "Now if you paint with the opposite color, in this case if you paint with black, and I can swap these colors by pressing X on the keyboard so that the background color is now the foreground color, I can start painting the side of the building.",
            "And by painting the side of the building, I'm re-introducing the color.",
            "So the adjustment layers inside of Photoshop give you the ability to apply color and tonal transformations to your images without harming the original pixel information.",
            "And because it's a layer, you can change the stacking order, you can turn the visibility on and off, and you can even come back and make modifications to the adjustment by clicking on this icon."

            "Option F9 or Alt F9 would be the keyboard shortcut to open up the Actions panel.",
            "What we want to do first is create a new action set.",
            "That way we can distinguish the differences between the actions that Adobe's created and the actions that we've created.",
            "So come down towards the bottom of the Actions panel and click the Create New Set button.",
            "Go ahead and name the set whatever you want.",
            "I'm going to go ahead and call it Matt's actions.",
            "And then you can go ahead and click Okay. We have the new action set.",
            "Once we have the new action set, we can come down and click the Create New Action button.",

            "I'm going to go ahead and call it BW for black and white.",
            "What we're going to do is ultimately create a black and white image.",
            "We're going to save this action to the Matt's actions set, or whatever you called your own action set.",
            "We don't need a color, which is just a way to label it within the Actions panel.",
            "And we don't need to assign a keyboard shortcut to it, so the function key is going to be set to None.",
            "Once you're done with that, you can go ahead and click Record.",
            "Now when you click Record, the Actions panel is going to record every command that you execute.",
            "It's not going to record any interface changes that you make.",
            "If you go the Window menu and under the Window menu you choose Notes, it's not going to record opening up the Notes panel.",
            "It's only going to record actual operations that you perform.",
            "So what we want to do is we want to add a black and white adjustment.",
            "If you go ahead and click that, you'll notice the adjustment has been added not only to the Layers panel but also to the action that you're creating.",
            "After setting the black and white adjustment, what we want to do is come up here to the Presets, and under the Presets we want to choose one.",
            "And I'm going to go with one called Infrared.",
            "It's going to create a more dramatic-looking black and white.",
            "After doing that I'd like to add a little bit of noise.",
            "So the first thing that I want to do is come up to the Filter menu.",
            "And under the Filter menu, I want to choose Convert for Smart Filters.",
            "Now you'll notice that it's grayed out, and it's grayed out because you need to make sure that the car layer is selected, and you'll notice that that action is recorded.",
            "Once you select the car layer, at that point you can come back to the Filter menu and choose Convert for Smart Filters.",
            "Again the dialogue box is just going to tell you that it's going to convert it to a smart object, which is what we want essentially, so go ahead and click Okay.",
            "Once we click",
            "Okay we can come back to the Filter menu, and here we can choose Noise.",
            "And we want to choose Add Noise.",
            "And in this case in terms of the distribution, I want to set it to Gaussian.",
            "And then in terms of the amount, I'm going to drag this back quite a bit somewhere around-I guess-three or four-somewhere in that range.",
            "You can also type in a value manually if you go ahead and just type in three.",
            "Once you're happy with the amount, you can come over and click Okay. Once you click Okay, you're all set.",
            "So what we want to do though is save out this image and store it on the desktop, and that can be recorded within the action as well.",
            "So come up to the File menu.",
            "Under the File menu, you can choose Save As.",
            "Navigate to the desktop, save this pic1.psd, and click Save.",
            "Again you want to maximize compatibility.",
            "That's fine.",
            "Go ahead and click Okay.",
            "And then once you save it you can close it.",
            "And all of these steps have been recorded by the Actions panel.",
            "Once you're done, you can come over here and click the stop recording button.",
            "And there you go.",
            "You created your own action.",
            "Let's go ahead and take a look at how we can apply this action to a different image.",
            "If you come up to the File menu, under the File menu you can choose Open. You want to browse to the Photoshop CS6 Resources folder.",
            "And there's Chapter 7.",
            "Open up pick2.psd and click Open.",
            "With this document open, what we want to do is select the BW action.",
            "We want to come down and click the Play button.",
            "When we do it performs all the operations.",
            "It saves the document, and it closes it.",
            "If we hide or minimize Photoshop, we can see we have these two documents on the desktop.",
            "You can go ahead and open them.",
            "Here on the Mac, I'm just going to go ahead and open both of them in a program called Preview.",
            "So I'm going to go ahead and choose Open With, and then I'm going to select Preview.",
            "And here we can see the two images that we converted to black and white and we added noise to.",
            "So the action's working just fine.",
            "So ultimately actions give you the ability to record steps and then reapply those steps to different images saving you a ton of time."

            "In this lesson, I want to share something with you that's near and dear to my heart in Photoshop.",
            "But I also think it's a bit of a game changer when it comes to working with images inside of Photoshop: linking smart objects.",
            "That was a test.",
            "Go right up to the word File on the pull-down menu, and you should see Place Embedded, Place Linked, and Package.",
            "Now if you don't see all 3 of those, go out to the Creative Cloud site and download the latest version of Photoshop.",
            "What's the difference between embedding and linking?",
            "That's a good question.",
            "We've been embedding for over 20 years.",
            "Linking is relatively new.",
            "When you embed an image into Photoshop into a layer, you're saying to Photoshop, \"Give me a copy of it.",
            "And you know what?",
            "When you're done, throw the original away.",
            "I don't need it anymore.",
            "\" When you link-and I love linking-when you link, you're saying to Photoshop, \"Keep an eye on the original for me.",
            "And if anybody changes the original, I want to see the changes reflected in this document or documents.\"",
            "So the obvious advantage here is say you're working with multiple designers- working on the same project.",
            "You're sharing those assets.",
            "Designers are making changes.",
            "The changes are reflected instantaneously inside of the documents, and you're saving time, but you're also being consistent.",
            "It's great!",
            "Now here's my example for you.",
            "I've got a poster, the Wild Leaves.",
            "They're going on tour, and they're going to be in 5 cities for 10 days.",
            "So we need 5 different posters, and I only have 2.",
            "But if you can do this twice, you can do it 100 times.",
            "And if I come over here, you can see this one and this one.",
            "Now notice there are things that are the same like the logo, information down here, the footer.",
            "But there are some things, also, that are different.",
            "The things that are the same-if you're working smart- should be linked.",
            "Actually, I already have some of this set up to save time, but I will take you through the procedure.",
            "Let's go into footer, right over here.",
            "Incidentally, you do have these assets if you want to download them and follow along.",
            "Common_bottom_bar is a linked smart object.",
            "And how do I know that?",
            "Now look right down here.",
            "See that icon?",
            "That is all I need to see.",
            "I know this is a linked smart object.",
            "Now if you don't have it open, I'm going to come up here and open up my properties.",
            "And",
            "if you don't see it, go to the word Window. You'll find it.",
            "When I select this layer, Properties lights up.",
            "I have an Edit Content button right here.",
            "Now understand and remember what linking is.",
            "Linking is linking to a physical file somewhere.",
            "If I click Edit Content, I am literally opening up that file.",
            "See right up here.",
            "Now what I'm going to do is add something.",
            "So we're going to go into File-this is how you do it- and go into Place Linked.",
            "Now what I want is the Play_fest_logo, right there, and I'm going to place it.",
            "And yes, if you're thinking this, I am placing a linked document inside of a linked document.",
            "It's kind of interesting, but it does work.",
            "I'm going to come down here, and I'm going to make that a little bit bigger.",
            "Go big or go home.",
            "Double click.",
            "And I've got my move tool selected, so I'm just going to drag it over real quick, just like that.",
            "I can get nice and pretty and fancy by using my up and down arrow keys, if I so choose.",
            "Now I like that.",
            "I'm happy with that.",
            "I put it on the footer.",
            "The footer is a linked smart object.",
            "I'm going to close this one out.",
            "I'm going to say Save, of course, and watch what happens.",
            "There it is.",
            "There it is on that one.",
            "Total control.",
            "It's changed based on the linked original.",
            "That's where the power is.",
            "Now you'll notice I do have one up here, too, and that's the same one.",
            "If I come over here into Playfest logo, you will notice there it is; and that, too, is linked.",
            "So they're all connected together.",
            "Let's say marketing comes in and decides they want a change of color on one of these- actually on all of them because it's a logo.",
            "So we come back, and we can do it a couple of ways.",
            "But say we come back over into this one right here.",
            "We go into footer, we select it, and we go back in to edit.",
            "Now understand you could do it from the other one that was at the top because they're all the same thing.",
            "If I select this here by coming over here-there it is, play_fest_logo- and go into Edit Content- let's do this.",
            "Let me pull this back for a second.",
            "They want the letter F the same color as the letter S. Now I know the numbers for those colors, so I'm going to double click on the F right over here and change these to 240.",
            "I'm using the Tab key to get to the next field, which makes it easier.",
            "And I'm going to go 100, and I'm going to go 30, just like that, and click OK.",
            "Now that's what I'm talking about.",
            "I'm going to save it.",
            "And there it is.",
            "Now let's go ahead and save this one.",
            "Now check it out.",
            "This one's changed.",
            "This one's changed.",
            "This one's changed down here because they are all the same BIOT.",
            "Playfest-it could be in a million places, but it's the one file that controls and reflects what we see inside of Photoshop.",
            "That's why this is so powerful.",
            "Now we've had an advantage in one respect.",
            "We've had the documents open.",
            "But what if you had 50 or 60 documents that were using the same image or asset?",
            "You wouldn't have them all open, would you?",
            "So let me show you a different way to kind of look at this.",
            "What we're going to do is close-let me go ahead and save this one- and let's go ahead and save this one, too.",
            "Then I'm going to close this one.",
            "So that one's not open, but they both have a share on Wild Leaves.",
            "So I'm going to go into-let me close this up.",
            "I'm going to go into band_logo right here.",
            "And that, again, is a linked, so I'm going to select it, open up my properties, and say Edit Contents.",
            "Let's do this.",
            "Let's take the word wild, and let's change it to that same color that I changed the letter F to.",
            "Let's go ahead and double click here.",
            "Okay.",
            "Let's come over here, type in 240, tab 100, tab 30.",
            "Click OK.",
            "Got it changed.",
            "Let's do one more thing though.",
            "Let's go into our FX button down here, and let's put a stroke on the word wild- just something small, like about 3.",
            "Let's see what that looks like.",
            "That's not too bad.",
            "And let's go ahead and put that on the inside.",
            "Click OK.",
            "Save it.",
            "Now it's reflected here, isn't it?",
            "But let me go ahead and open up the other one.",
            "Now I'm going to drag it over from my other screen.",
            "It's just easier this way for me.",
            "And you can do that, too.",
            "I like that about Photoshop.",
            "See, this one didn't change because it wasn't open.",
            "If it's open it's automatic.",
            "It's going to change it.",
            "If it's not open, it's going to ask you, \"Do you want to change it?\"",
            "So if I come down here, you can see the word changed one, so it's giving me a visual that something needs changing.",
            "But if we come back over here-let me go ahead and close footer.",
            "We don't need that open.",
            "And we get into band-logo, you can see down here that the logo has changed to a warning indicating that it is modified.",
            "One is changed.",
            "The reason I've got missing zero and changed one down here is because I've chosen Smart Objects right there.",
            "Very easy to do-come up to the word Layer, go down to Smart Objects, and just say, basically, Update.",
            "There you go.",
            "Now let's look at one more thing here.",
            "Let me go back to this one.",
            "This image right here-let me go ahead and close some stuff down and open some others.",
            "Notice the icon right here.",
            "That is an embedded smart object.",
            "Now if I select it, it says up here embedded not linked.",
            "But if I say Edit Contents, it functions a lot like a linked smart object.",
            "It's got layers.",

            "Conversely, if you have something linked you could later on embed it, if you want to do that, too, but the control that you have when you're working with these smart objects is absolutely amazing.",

            "If we move this document or if we move the files that they're associated with, it's possible you might see Missing down here has a 1 or a 2.",

            "The most fundamental skill that you need inside of Adobe Photoshop is having the ability to make selections.",
            "Remember, all of your images are composed of pixels.",
            "Having the ability to isolate certain pixels ultimately gives you the control over what you're going to do with that image.",
            "So what I'd like to do is just review some of the basic Selection tools to get you off and running.",
            "You'll notice here inside the Tools panel we have the Rectangular Marquee tool.",
            "Underneath this tool are some hidden tools.",
            "We have the Elliptical Marquee tool.",
            "And then we have a Single Row Marquee tool and a Single Column Marquee tool.",
            "These two tools are best used when dealing with web design.",
            "So what I'd like to do is choose the Rectangular Marquee tool and select this square.",
            "To select it, all you have to do is click and drag.",
            "Notice you get a little head's up display telling you the width and the height of your selection.",
            "If you hold down the shift key, you'll constrain it to a square so both the width and the height are the same.",
            "When you let go of the mouse, you have your selection.",
            "And you can see, you have a series of marching ants which represent the selected area.",
            "Now if you want to deselect this, meaning you no longer want these pixels to be selected, you can come up to the Select menu.",
            "And from there you can choose Deselect.",
            "Command D is the keyboard shortcut here on the Mac.",
            "It would be Control D on Windows.",
            "So there's the Rectangular Marquee Selection tool, but what about the Elliptical Marquee tool?",
            "Well, it too behaves much in the same way.",
            "If you click and drag, you can create a circle or an elliptical type of selection.",
            "Now in this case, you may want to create the selection out from the center.",
            "I'm going to go ahead and deselect this, Command D or Control D. To drag out a selection from the center, simply hold down the Option key on the Mac, Alt on Windows, and you'll notice you're dragging out from the center at this point.",
            "And again, you've successfully made a selection.",
            "Now you can move the selection by placing your cursor inside of it, clicking and dragging, or using the arrow keys on your keyboard to nudge it around.",
            "So what about a more difficult shape, like this triangle?",
            "Let's go ahead and deselect this circle.",
            "Command D or Control D will do that.",
            "You could always come over and choose the Lasso tool.",
            "The Lasso tool really is best used for organic areas or adding or subtracting from an existing selection.",
            "It's a freehand selection tool, so I'm not good enough to click and drag a triangle, but I can attempt it.",
            "When I let go of the mouse, this is the selection.",
            "It's really not the best.",
            "So I'm going to go ahead and deselect that, Command D or Control D. Your best bet is to use something like the Polygonal Lasso tool.",
            "This gives you the ability to create precise lines with angles.",
            "For example, if I click here and then drag up, I can click again and then continue to drag, click again and then continue to drag and close the path by coming back to the beginning or double clicking the mouse.",
            "And that will close the selection.",
            "So the Polygonal Lasso tool is better suited for objects that really can't be selected using the Elliptical or Rectangular Marquee tools and aren't organic enough to justify using the traditional Lasso tool.",
            "So I'm going to go ahead and deselect that.",
            "there is another tool hidden underneath that which is the Magnetic Lasso tool, which allows Photoshop to compare the edge of the foreground object from the background object.",
            "I'm not going to go ahead and review that right now.",
            "Instead what I want to take a look at is another Selection tool called the Quick Selection tool.",
            "The Quick Selection tool gives you the ability to make selections based upon color.",
            "So in this case if I wanted to select the white background, with the Quick Selection tool all you have to do is come over here and make sure that you have the New Selection option highlighted here in the Options bar.",
            "Then just click and drag.",
            "And you just want to make sure that you stay within the white area.",
            "And as you drag, you'll notice you're selecting the white pixels.",
            "Now if you get careless and select something by accident, you can always come over and choose this option, which is Subtract From Selection.",
            "Or you can use any one of the other Selection tools to subtract from your selection.",
            "So making selections inside of Photoshop, like I said, is a fundamental skill.",
            "And these tools are tools that you'll use all the time to create these selections."

            ">> Photoshop Artboards are really useful, especially for designing for mobile apps and responsive design.",
            "You can design for multiple screens, and see the experience and the flow across your entire design in a single document.",
            "Artboards are containers that act like special layer groups.",
            "And layers placed within an artboard are grouped beneath the artboard in a layers panel and are clipped by the artboard boundaries on the canvas.",
            "You can have multiple design layouts within one document by using artboards.",
            "This makes it easy to copy content between artboards, view everything altogether and also keeps your designs organized.",
            "When creating a new document in Photoshop, Select Artboard from the Document Type, then select the desired artboard size.",
            "In this example, I'm selecting iPhone 5.",
            "If you already have a Photoshop document without artboards, you can also easily add them later.",
            "When we switch to a document that already has content, to change artboard properties, you can select the artboard in the Layers panel, you can then edit artboard properties such as size, orientation, alighnment and more using the Tool Options bar, the Properties panel, or by using the artboard handles to manually re-size the artboard.",
            "Let me show my rulers.",
            "Notice that the guides are relative to the artboard that's moving.",
            "You can use the guide layouts to align elements in your design by assigning guides to your desired artboards, or to the document.",
            "You can also use artboard-specific grids for aligning objects.",
            "Let me turn mine on by choosing View, Show, Grid.",
            "Just like the guides, the grids also move with the artboard.",
            "Let me turn off the grids again.",
            "There are many ways to add and edit artboards.",
            "With an artboard selected, use the on-canvas controls to easily add artboards to your document.",
            "Or click the \"+\" icon while holding Alt or Option to easily duplicate the artboard.",
            "Or use the Artboard tool to create an artboard of a different size.",
            "Each artboard has a specific name that appears as a name label on the canvas, and you can edit the artboard names so that they make more sense to you.",
            "Just double-click the name in the Layers panel.",
            "You can also toggle the visibility of the artboard names on or off, By choosing View, Show, Artboard Names.",
            "I'll show the artboard names again.",
            "In the Layers panel, each artboard has its own set of layers that you can arrange.",
            "If you have a lot of content, you can filter the layers in the layers panel by artboard.",
            "If you select an artboard, or select content on an artboard with the Auto-select option enabled, only the contents of the selected artboard will appear in the Layers panel.",
            "It's easy to share content between artboards or move content in or out of an artboard.",
            "If you drag content associated with an artboard outside the bounds of an artboard, the content is no longer nested within it.",
            "Layers outside of artboards are not clipped by any of the artboards. Dragging artwork inside the bounds of an artboard auto-nests the content within that artboard.",
            "You can select the Prevent Auto-Nesting option in the Layers panel to keep layer content from nesting automatically in or out of an artboard.",
            "You can also lock the position of an artboard and its contents on the canvas so that it stays in place.",
            "Export optimized content easily by right-clicking any content in the artboard, then choosing Export As... to get just those layers, or you can choose File, Export As... to export each artboard as a flattened and optimized PNG or JPEG.",
            "Another option is to export each artboard as single PSD files.",
            "You can also save your design as a PDF or each artboard as its own page, allowing it to easily send the whole design for review or other purposes.",
            "Photoshop gives you even more freedom and flexibility to easily convey responsive web design, mobile app design and much more.",
            "Give Artboards a try today."
